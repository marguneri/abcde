# Vård utan samtycke

This section provides an algorithm for determining whether patients can be treated (i.e. interventions performed) despite lack of consent according to Swedish law.

### 1-Påbörjat eller överhängande brottsligt angrepp på person/egendom?
* Åtgärder (troligen fysiska) får göras enligt **nödvärn** (Brottsbalk (1962:700) 24 kap 1 §).
* Åtgärder som gäller specificeras ej i lagtexten, utan proportionaliteten till angreppet gäller.

### 2-Fara som hotar patientens liv eller hälsa?
* Åtgärder (troligen fysiska) får göras enligt **nödrätt** (Brottsbalk (1962:700) 24 kap 4 §).
* Åtgärder som gäller specificeras ej i lagtexten, utan proportionaliteten till faran gäller.

### 3-Akut och allvarligt hot till liv/hälsa och patientens vilja kan inte utredas?
* Vård som behövs för att avvärja fara som akut och allvarligt hotar patientens liv eller hälsa får ges enligt **Patientlag** (2014:821) 4 kap 4 § även om patientens vilja på grund av medvetslöshet eller av någon annan orsak inte kan utredas.

### 4-Allvarlig psykisk störning?
* **Allvarlig psykisk störning**: psykos (oavsett orsak), svår depression med självmordstankar, akut konfusion, mani, svår personlighetsstörning med impulskontrollstörning och/eller aggressivt beteende, svår anorexia nervosa, felmissbruk, utvecklingsstörning, demens
* **Oundgängligt behov av psykiatrisk dygnetsrumsvård**, inklusive om patienten är farlig för annans personliga säkerhet eller fysiska eller psykiska hälsa
* **Motsätter sig vård** eller att det finns grundad anledning att anta att vården inte kan ges med patientens samtycke
* Då får legitimerad läkare enligt **Lag (1991:1128)** om psykiatrisk tvångsvård fatta beslut om att utfärda vårdityg och göra följande åtgärder innan intagningsbeslut: hindra patienten från att lämna vårdinrättningen, tvångssedera, bälta, tvångsmedicinera för akuta tillstånd. Kroppsvisitation får inte göras.

### 5-Är patienten beslutskapabel?
* Om patienten inte bedöms beslutskapabel (t ex svår demens) kan man motivera behandling mot patientens vilja enligt "presumerat" eller "hypotetiskt" samtycke, dock finns inget stöd i lagen för det
* Om patienten bedöms beslutskapabel får behandling inte genomföras utan patientens samtycke enligt Patientlag (2014:821) 4 kap 2 §

### 6-Patienten är ett barn
* Vårdnadshavare har både rätt och skyldighet att bestämma gällande vård och behandling som rör barnet
* Barnets inställning till den aktuella vården ska tillmätas betydelse i förhållande till hans eller hennes ålder och mognad enligt Patientlag (2014:821) 4 kap 3 §. Det innebär att ett barn kan bedömas lämplig att fatta egna beslut redan innan 18 års ålder

### 7-Anhöriga/Närstående/God man/Förvaltare
* Anhöriga och andra närstående har inte några rättsliga befogenheter att agera som ställföreträdare för en vuxen person
* En god man eller förvaltare kan inte samtycka till vård och omsorg mot den enskildes vilja

# Cardiac Arrest

## INTRODUCTION
Cardiac arrest is a condition whereby cardiac output is absent or so diminished that:
* the patient is unconscious
* spontaneous breathing is absent or ineffective
* there are no signs of life (e.g. no palpable pulse)

* Young patient, suspected poisoning, hypothermia, massive pulmonary embolism
* Call: _______________
### 3. Child?
* Call: _______________
### 4. Pregnant?
* Call: _______________
* Prepare for perimortem sectio
### 5. Thoracotomy?
* Traumatic cardiac arrest with signs of life at the scene; tamponade
* Call: _______________
### 6. Ultrasound
* Position by the bedside
* Prepare phased-array probe, linear probe, loop recording
### 7. Crowd-control
* Personnel not involved in immediate patient care outside the work zone
## AMBULANCE REPORT

* Ventilation: 2 for every 30 compressions (15 for child); 10/min (10-20/min) if intubated
* Rhythm analysis: every 2 min. Consider pre-charge def (200-360 J; 4J/kg). If VF/pVT shock or resume compressions while charging/shock, then resume compressions directly
* Adrenalin 0.1 mg/ml 10 ml push (10 mg/kg) directly if PEA/asystole or after 3rd defibrillation; then every 4th min.
* Amiodarone 300 mg (5 mg/kg) IV push after 3rd def; 150 mg (5 mg/kg) after 5th def

| Acidemia | • Sodium bicarbonate 50 mg/ml 200 ml IV push |
| Hypothermia | • Bilat. chest tubes, 300 ml NaCl 40°C, drain + repeat<br>• ECMO |

## FACTORS SUGGESTING POOR PROGNOSIS
* CPR > 40 min in initially shockable rhythm, CPR > 20 min in asystole
* Initial rhythm asystole/PEA (as opposed to VF/pVT)
* Unwitnessed cardiac arrest
* Absence of bystander CPR
* End-tidal CO₂ < 1.33 kPa after 20 min CPR
* Cardiac standstill on ultrajud (0.6% survival)

## BREAKING BAD NEWS
* Room where doors can be closed, and everyone can be seated
* Introduce yourself, the nurse/social worker introduces him/herself
* Greet family members
* Check what the family already knows
* Fill in the gaps, recount chronologically what happened until termination of resuscitation and state that NAME is dead
* Pause, let family members break the silence and answer their questions
* Minimize potential feelings of guilt by stating that the outcome did not hinge on what the family/relatives/friends did or did not do
* Leave the family with the nurse/social worker

# Traumatic Cardiac Arrest

## INTRODUCTION
Traumatic cardiac arrest refers to major trauma followed by cardiac arrest (unconcious + no effective breathing + no signs of life). Cardiac arrest results from massive hemorrhage, tension pneumothorax or tamponade. There is little or no value in performing chest compressions and administering adrenalin. This section deals on traumatic cardiac arrest.

A "medical" cardiac arrest can be followed by minor trauma or result from minor blunt trauma to the chest which has induced an arrhythmia.

If decision to pursue management, see Major Trauma.

# Crashing Patient

## INTRODUCTION
The crashing patient checklist is designed for pre-arrest patients for whom the emergency physician has not had any forewarning and knows little if anything about the patient. The context could be phrased as "Patient looks like sh*t" + "I don't know what condition the patient has." It focuses on a considering a handful of "rescue interventions" designed to rapidly address ABC problems, which are those that kill quickly.

## CONTEXT
* SpO2 and/or blood pressure alarmingly low and dropping
* No knowledge of the patient
* No time to prepare

## MANAGEMENT

# Neonatal Resuscitation

## INTRODUCTION
'Neonatal Resuscitation' refers here to the systematic initial management of the newborn. This initial management is organized according to the ABC sequence. Assessments and treatments are carried out simultaneously.

## 1. INITIAL MANAGEMENT
1. **Dry the infant**. The stimulation from drying the newborn is often enough to induce adequate breathing
2. **Assess breathing and tone after 30 sec**. A child with vigorous regular breathing, normal tone and a heart rate > 100/min requires no measures other than preventing hypothermia
3. **Cord clamping** should be delayed > 1 min. The optimal timing of cord clamping if resuscitation is indicated is unknown, but delayed clamping is presumably of benefit to the neonate if feasible

## 2. AIRWAY
1. **Head in neutral position**: if resuscitation is required, place the newborn supine with the head in neutral position (a towel placed under the shoulders may be required)

## 3. BREATHING
1. **Ventilate the newborn** with bag-valve-mask using room air at a rate of 30-60/min (1 second for each inflation).
2. **Ensure that the chest passively rises** with each inflation, otherwise one or several of following until effective ventilation is established: jaw-thrust, change mask, ventilate with 2-person technique, add OPA/NPA/LMA, laryngoscopy, suction, endotracheal intubation
3. **Ventilate 30-60/min for 30 sec**

## 4. CIRCULATION
1. **Assess the heart rate** using a stethoscope placed at the heart apex or an EKG
2. **Start chest compressions** if the heart rate is < 60/min despite adequate ventilation:
   - Encircle the chest with the hands, two thumbs on the lower third of the sternum
   - Compression depth 1/3 of the chest depth
   - 3:1 compressions:ventilations with each "event" 0.5 seconds (90 compressions/min)
   - Ventilate with 100% oxygen
3. **Check the heart rate after 30 seconds**. Discontinue chest compressions when the heart rate is > 60/min otherwise resume chest compressions, proceed as below

## 5. DRUGS
1. **Adrenalin** 10 μg/kg (0.3 ml of 0.1 mg/ml) via an umbilical vein catheter or intraosseous
2. **Crystalloid or blood** 10 ml/kg (30 ml) bolus via an umbilical vein catheter are indicated if shock is suspected.
3. **Naloxone 0.4 mg/ml** 0.5 ml IM (consider)
4. **Glucose 50 mg/ml** 10 ml via umbilical vein catheter or intraosseous after 10 min

## 6. TERMINATION RESUSCITATION
- **Consider terminating resuscitation** if signs of life are absent despite > 20 min of resuscitation

# Anaphylaxis

## INTRODUCTION
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the two criteria are fulfilled:

1. Acute onset of **hypotension** or **bronchospasm** or **laryngeal involvement** after exposure to a known or highly probable allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours), even in the absence of typical skin involvement.

2. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with simultaneous involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
  - **Respiratory compromise** (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia)
  - **Reduced BP** or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)
  - **Severe gastrointestinal symptoms** (eg, severe crampy abdominal pain, repetitive vomiting), especially after exposure to non-food allergens

## MANAGEMENT

### 1. Unconscious + Barely Breathing?

# Angioedema

## INTRODUCTION
Angioedema results from increased vascular permeability in subcutaneous/submucosal tissue.
Angioedema may be:
- histamine-mediated (e.g. allergic angioedema); symptoms may evolve over minutes
- bradykinin-mediated (e.g. ACE-inhibitor induced angioedema, hereditary angioedema); 
 symptoms evolves gradually over many hours

## CONTEXT
- Family history of angioedema (hereditary angioedema types 1 and 2 are inherited in an 
 autosomal dominant manner), ACE inhibitors, Angiotension II receptor blockers, NSAIDs
- May present with swelling of the face, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting; a 
 local burning sensation without pronounced itchiness

## ABCDE
| A | - Swelling of the lips, tongue, eyelids; symmetric/diffuse suggests histamine-mediated; asymmetrical/focal suggests bradykinin-mediated
   - Voice changes (dysphonia) suggests laryngeal involvement |
| B | - Bronchospasm is present in the setting of histamine-induced angioedema |
| C | - Hypotension is present in the setting of histamine-induced angioedema |
| E | - Swelling of the face, extremities, genitalia
   - Urticaria in the setting of histamine-induced angioedema
   - Erythema marginatum (non-pruritic erythematous rings on the torso) may be present with hereditary angioedema |

## MANAGEMENT

### 1. ENT and/or Anesthesia?
- Indication: threatened upper airway (lip/tongue edema, stridor, hoarseness)
- Call ENT _____ and/or Anesthesia _____

### 2. Oxygen?
- Indication: hypoxemia, upper airway compromise (e.g. stridor, swelling, subjective narrowing)
- Options:
 - Non-rebreather facemask 10-15 L/min
 - Oxymask 5-10 L/min
 - Nasal cannula 15 L/min can be placed under the non-rebreather facemask

### 3. Adrenalin IM?
- Indication: laryngeal swelling. Adrenalin does not work as well in bradykinin-mediated as opposed to histamine-mediated angioedema but is not harmful and is diagnostically helpful
- Adrenalin 1 mg/ml 0.5 ml IM (0.15 mg or 10 μg/kg in children). The dose may be repeated every 5 minutes if necessary

### 4. Cricothyrotomy?
- Indication: stridor, patient sitting bolt upright (may be unable to lie down) and struggling for breath. Immediate risk of obstruction and hypoxemic cardiac arrest
1. Oxygen 15 L/min via non-rebreather facemask + 15 L/min underneath via nasal cannula
2. Esketamine 60 mg IV over 2 min (0.75 mg/kg) to completely dissociate the patient
3. Cricothyrotomy (stab-twist-bougie-tube) while the patient is breathing

### 5. Nasolaryngoscopy
- Indication: to determine the degree of laryngeal edema and posterior tongue
1. Anesthetize the nostril and upper pharynx with Lidokain/Nafazolin
2. Fiberbronchoscope or fiberlaryngoscope

### 6. Intubation?
- Indications: factors suggesting the need for intubation {Farkas, 2021 #3662}:
 - Stridor, hoarse or muffled voice, and dyspnea
 - Inability to handle secretions
 - Significant/increasing laryngeal edema or impending closure of the posterior pharynx
- Awake nasotracheal intubation {Farkas, 2021 #3662}
- Set-up and readiness for cricothyrotomy {Farkas, 2021 #3662}

### 7. Tranexamic acid?
- Indication: bradykinin-mediated angioedema (focal/asymmetric swelling, non-pruritic)
- Tranexamic acid 100 mg/ml 10 ml IV over 10 min. Repeat q4h PRN

### 8. C1-esterase inhibitor (Berinert®) or Icatibant (Fyrazir®)?
- Indication: bradykinin-mediated angioedema with threatened airway (lip/tongue edema)
- Berinert® 1000 - 1500 IE slow IV infusion (20 IE/kg, rounded off to nearest 500 IE)
- Icatibant (Fyrazir®) 30 mg SC. May be less effective than C1-inhibitor concentrate.

### 9. Fresh Frozen Plasma?
- Indication: bradykinin-mediated angioedema with threatened airway and neither C1-inhibitor concentrate nor Icatibant available
- Risk: occasional paradoxical effect of making the angioedema acutely worse
- 2 Units IV, 2 additional units subsequently PRN

### 10. Corticosteroids & Antihistamines
- Indication: histamine-mediated angioedema
- Betamethasone 8 mg PO or IV (0.1 mg/kg for children)
- Desloratadine (Aerius®) 10 mg PO (6-12 years old 5 mg, < 6 years 2.5 mg)

### 11. Disposition
- Monitor depending on degree of airway compromise. Bradykinin-mediated angioedema can progress over the course of hours and treatments take > 30 minutes for onset of action.

# Epiglottitis

## INTRODUCTION
Epiglottitis (swelling of the epiglottis) is usually caused by infection, rarely thermal injury.

## CONTEXT
- Children present with high fever, sore throat, toxicity with rapid progression.
- Adult patients present with dysphagia, odynophagia, sore throat, occasionally ear pain.

## ABCDE
| A | - Dysphonia and a muffled voice are common; hoarseness is unusual
    - Stridor is a common initial symptom in children with epiglottitis
    - Inability to swallow own saliva suggests impending airway compromise
    - Patients assuming the "sniffing position" are at risk for acute airway obstruction |
| B | - Dyspnea is a common initial symptom in children < 24 months
    - Intercostal retractions is a common initial symptom in children < 24 months |
| D | - Altered mental status is a common initial symptom in children < 24 months |
| E | - Fever is a common in children < 24 months while absent in up to 50% of adult cases |

## MANAGEMENT
### 1. Call ENT and/or Anesthesia
- Call ENT and/or anesthesia if epiglottitis is suspected

### 2. Avoid Aggravating Measures
- Direct examination or manipulation of the pharynx should be avoided
- Patients assuming the sniffing position should not be laid flat

### 3. Equipment
- Ensure that equipment required for bag-valve-mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation and cricothyrotomy (adults) or needle cricothyrotomy (children) is available

### 4. Flexible Laryngoscopy
- Flexible laryngoscopy is the diagnostic procedure of choice

### 5. Endotracheal Intubation?
- The decision to intubate depends on epiglottitis severity, clinical course (increased severity of the past 4-6 hours) and the presence of immunocompromise or diabetes

### 6. Antibiotics
- Cefotaxime or Ceftriaxone 1-2 g IV (50-100 mg/kg) are first-line antibiotics

### 7. Admission
- Unintubated patients are often admitted to the ICU for close monitoring

## Treatments of Unclear Benefit
- The role of corticosteroids is unresolved
- Adrenalin can lead to initial improvement followed by "rebound" worsening

# Foreign Body Airway Obstruction

## INTRODUCTION
- Setting: usually occurs while the patient is eating or drinking
- Symptoms: sudden onset of shortness of breath, coughing, inspiratory stridor, noisy breathing, inability to speak, slight hemoptysis, unconsciousness
- Risk factors: decreased level of consciousness (e.g. secondary to drug or alcohol intoxication), impaired swallowing and cough reflexes (e.g. secondary to Parkinson's disease or stroke), mental impairment, dementia, older age

## ABCDE
| A | - Inspiratory stridor, noisy breathing, inability to speak
    - Central cyanosis |
| B | - Low SpO2
    - Tachypnea
    - Decreased tidal volumes, intercostal recessions, use of accessory respiratory muscles |
| C | - Tachycardia |
| D | - Decreased level of consciousness |

## UNCONSCIOUS?
### 1. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(CPR) to remove the obstruction as opposed to promoting circulation. CPR is thus indicated even if a pulse is present

### 2. Laryngoscopy & one or more of following measures
- MaGill forceps to attempt to remove a supraglottic foreign body
- Cricothyrotomy (> 10 years) or needle cricothyrotomy (< 10 years) if a supraglottic foreign body cannot be removed
- Endotracheal intubation in the setting of infraglottic or non-visible foreign body. Push the foreign body into one of the bronchi, withdraw the tube slightly and ventilate the other lung

## INEFFECTIVE COUGH? UNABLE TO TALK? CYANOTIC?
1. Back blows x 5 delivered with the heel of the hand between the patient's shoulder blades
2. Abdominal thrust x 5 or chest thrusts x 5 for patients < 1 year old and in advanced pregnancy
3. Inspect the oral cavity, remove visible foreign body but no blind finger sweep
4. Repeat until improvement or unconscious

## EFFECTIVE COUGH? CAN TALK BETWEEN COUGHING SPELLS?
Encourage coughing. Back blows and chest/abdominal compressions are not indicated

## AFTERCARE
- Patients with residual cough, swallowing difficulty or sensation of a foreign object stuck in the throat may have residual foreign material in the upper or lower airway. Bronchoscopy?
- Abdominal thrusts and chest compressions may cause internal injuries

# Hypoxemia / Low SpO₂

## MANAGEMENT
### 1. Supplemental Oxygen
- Indication: all initially, titrate as needed
- Non-Rebreather Mask (up to 15 L/min) +/- nasal cannula (15 L/min)

### 2. Ketamine?
- Indication: combative / agitated / delirious patient

- Consider Naloxone (0.08 mg IV)
- Consider NIPPV (EPAP 3 cm H₂O; IPAP 8 cm H₂O) after ruling out pneumothorax

### 5. Pneumothorax / Pleural Fluid?
- Suggestive findings pneumothorax: absent lung-sliding (not diagnostic), lung-point (diagnostic)
- Suggestive findings pleura fluid: visible on ultrasound, positive V-sign
- Consider 12 F catheter in the anterior axillary line 4th intercostal space

### 6. Pulmonary Edema?
- Suggestive findings: bilateral B-lines, decreased contractility, IVC > 2 cm, IVC-CI < 50%
- See Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema

### 7. Pulmonary Embolism?
- Suggestive findings: hypotension, EKG showing RV-strain (e.g. negative T waves in V1-V4 + III; RBBB), ultrasound showing increased right ventricular size, IVC > 2 cm
- See Pulmonary Embolism (High Risk)

### 8. COPD / Asthma Exacerbation?
- Suggestive findings: decreased inspiration/expiration ratio, expiratory wheezes on lung-auscultation, absence of EKG/ultrasound findings suggestive of alternative diagnosis, elevated EtCO₂ in patients with COPD
- See Asthma Exacerbation or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbation

### 9. Pneumonia?
- Suggestive findings: asymmetric findings on lung-auscultation /ultrasound exam, fever
- See Pneumonia

### 10. Falsely Low?
- Suggestive findings: poor pulse-oximetry curve, nail-polish, methemoglobinemia
- Measure arterial blood gas

### 11. NIPPV Settings Titration
- Low PaO2/SpO2: increase EPAP and increased FiO₂
- High PaCO2: increase P-support (IPAP - EPAP)

### 12. PCR COVID-19 / Influenza / RSV

## Differential Diagnosis of False SpO₂

| Category | Causes |
|----------|---------|
| Falsely Low | - Poorly placed pulse oximeter or pulse oximeter of wrong size - Low perfusion: peripheral vasoconstriction (e.g. secondary to hypothermia or vasoconstrictng drugs), hypotension, concurrent blood pressure measurement - Certain nail polishes - Intravenous dyes (e.g. methylene blue, fluorescein) - Increased venous pulsations (e.g. tricuspid regurgitation) - Methemoglobinemia at low levels (< 10%) |
| Falsely High | - Mechanical / environmental causes (poorly placed probe or probe of the wrong size, high-intensity ambient light, motion artifacts) - Carbon monoxide poisoning; carboxyhemoglobin (hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide) has similar light absorption at 660 nm to oxyhemoglobin - Methemoglobinemia; methemoglobin (hemoglobin containing the ferric iron Fe³⁺ as opposed to the oxygen-carrying ferrous ion Fe²⁺) at high levels (> 30%) results in a SpO₂ of 85% regardless of the actual SaO₂ |
# Asthma Exacerbation

## INTRODUCTION
Asthma is a disease characterized by recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing caused by lower airway inflammation, bronchospasm and mucous plugging

## CONTEXT
- **Risk factors for severe asthma exacerbations** include previous severe exacerbation (requiring ICU admission or endotracheal intubation), recent or repeated assessments in the ED, poorly controlled asthma (use of > 1 canister of short-acting beta agonist per month, recent or current course of oral glucocorticoids), poor compliance.
- **Presentation**: dyspnea, chest-tightness, cough, wheezing, decreased level of consciousness (in life-threatening cases)

## ABCDE
| Section | Findings |
|---------|----------|
| A | **Inability to complete sentences** in one breath suggests acute severe asthma |
| B | **SpO₂ < 92%** suggests life-threatening asthma<br>**Silent chest** suggests life-threatening asthma<br>**Feeble respiratory effort** suggests life-threatening asthma |
| C | **Hypotension** suggests life-threatening asthma<br>**Tachycardia > 110 beats/min** suggests acute severe asthma<br>**Arrythmia** suggests life-threatening asthma |
| D | **Altered level of consciousness** suggests life-threatening asthma |
| E | **Cyanosis** suggests life-threatening asthma |

## BEDSIDE TESTS
| Test | Findings |
|------|-----------|
| BBT | **PaO₂ < 8 kPa (60 mm Hg)** suggests life-threatening asthma<br>**Normal PaCO₂**: life-threatening asthma. **Elevated PaCO₂**: near-fatal asthma |

## MANAGEMENT
### 1. Unconscious + Barely Breathing?
- Adrenalin 0.1 mg/ml 0.5 - 1 ml (1 μg/kg) IV over 30 sec
- Succylcholine 50 mg/ml 2 ml (1.5 mg/kg) or Rocuronium 10 mg/ml 8 ml (1.2 mg/kg) IV

### 5. Beta-2 Agonist IM/IV/SC
- **Indication**: in cases of severe or near-fatal asthma, the resulting hypoventilation may prevent effective delivery of nebulized beta-2 agonists. Adrenergic therapy can be given by alternative routes. Consider one of the following options:
- Adrenalin 1 mg/ml 0.5 ml (10 μg/kg) IM in the thigh antero-laterally
- Terbutaline (Bricanyl®) 0.5 mg/ml 0.5 ml (10 μg/kg) SC every 20 min x 3

- Salbutamol (Ventoline®) 2 mg/ml 1 ml + 9 ml NaCl; 1 ml (15 μg/kg) IV over 1 min

### 6. Ipratropium Bromide
- **Indication**: the addition of inhaled short-acting anticholinergics to inhaled short-acting beta agonists reduced hospitalization and improved pulmonary function
- Ipratropium bromide 0.5 mg Neb (< 5 years 0.25 mg). Repeated dose every 20 min PRN

### 7. NIPPV?
- **Indication**: uncertain benefit. Recommended for 5-10 min to avoid endotracheal intubation
- IPAP/EPAP 8 cm/3 cm H₂O. P-ramp 100 msec. Continue bronchodilator therapy.

- Patients who have not experienced substantial improvement after 4-6 hrs of care in the ED
- Patients whose PEF is < 40% of predicted or of personal best
- Patients whose PEF is 40-70% and for whom return to home is considered unsafe

# Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema

## INTRODUCTION
- In **cardiogenic pulmonary edema**, excess fluid in the alveoli results from a high pulmonary capillary pressure corresponding to a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure > 18 mm Hg. Pulmonary edema is the manifestation of left-sided backward heart failure.
- **"Flash" pulmonary edema** refers to the sudden, dramatic onset of cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
- **"SCAPE"** (Sympathetic Crashing Acute Pulmonary Edema): hypertension + severe acute pulmonary edema

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
- **Excessive left heart preload**, e.g. excessive salt or water intake, salt-retaining medications (steroids, NSAIDs), blood transfusion, decreased fluid loss due to nonadherence to medications, renal failure, acute mitral or aortic valve insufficiency
- **Decreased left heart contractility**, e.g. myocardial ischemia / infarction, arrhythmia, other causes of decreased contractility (e.g. viral myocarditis, hypothyroidism, toxins), structural problems (e.g. valvulopathy from infectious endocarditis, papillary muscle rupture)
- **Increased left heart afterload**, e.g. hypertensive crisis (e.g. due to intoxication, catecholamine), critical aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

## ULTRASOUND
- **Reduced LVEF** SN 81% SP 81% LR+ 4.1 LR- 0.24 for acute heart failure (AHF) in the ED. EPSS (E-Point Septal Separation): normal < 7 mm, LVEF = 75.5 - (EPSS x 2.5)
- Doppler ultrasound may reveal **mechanical problems** e.g. mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal defect, and pericardial fluid secondary to free wall rupture.
- **IVC ≥ 20.5 mm** distinguishes decompensated from compensated HF SN 90% SP 73%.
- **Pleural effusion(s)** SN 64% SP 72% LR+ 2.0 LR- 0.49 for AHF in the ED.
- **Positive B-line scan** SN 85% SP 93% LR+ 7.4 LR- 0.16 for AHF in the ED.
- **Triple scan ultrasound** (limited echo, lung - IVC < 15% collapse on inspiration) increased SN from 73% to 100% and SP from 79% to 95% for the diagnosis of AHF in the ED.

## MANAGEMENT

### 1. Upright Positioning
- Place the patient in the upright position by elevating the head of the bed

### 2. Supplemental Oxygen?
- **Indicated** to maintain a SpO₂ > 90% or a PaO₂ > 8 kPa (60 mm Hg). Hyperoxia should be avoided

### 3. Vasodilators?
- **Indications**: severe hypertension and urgent need for afterload reduction, acute mitral or aortic regurgitation, as adjunct to diuretics in patients with inadequate response, patients with refractory HF and low cardiac output
- **Contraindications**: SBP < 110 mm Hg, significant mitral or aortic stenosis, predominant right heart failure; nitroglycerin contraindicated in the setting of recent sildenafil use
- Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL every 60 sec until BP responds and dyspnea improves
- Nitroglycerin 1 mg/ml 0.5 mg bolus IV q3min
- Nitroglycerin 1 mg/ml 10 ml in 40 ml saline = 200 μg/ml. 1 μg/kg/min, titrate up

### 4. Diuretics?
- **Indication**: signs and symptoms of congestion; not initially recommended in SCAPE
- **Contraindication**: SBP < 85 mm Hg; caution in the setting of aortic stenosis
- Furosemid 40 mg IV for patients not taking diuretics. For patients taking oral loop diuretics, at least the whole oral daily dose given IV is recommended (e.g. ≥ 80 mg IV for a patient taking 40 mg PO twice daily)

### 5. Morphine?
- **Indication**: particularly anxious, restless or distressed patients. Yet not routinely recommended. Morphine is associated with increased mortality in AHF OR 4.84
- Morphine 4 mg IV along with antiemetic (e.g. Metoclopramide 10 mg IV). Alertness and respiratory effort should be monitored frequently

### 6. CPAP / NIPPV?
- **Indications**: respiratory acidosis and when respiratory distress and hypoxia persist despite supplementary oxygen. Respiratory distress is suggested by respiratory rate > 25 /min, SpO₂ < 90%, increased work of breathing, orthopnea. Reduces mortality NNT 14
- **Contraindications**: SBP < 85 mm Hg, vomiting, possible pneumothorax, and depressed consciousness
- CPAP may be applied first (start at 5 cm H₂O, titrate up to 15 cm if needed)
- NIPPV (10/5 cm H₂O) if persisting hypercapnia, signs of fatigue, history of COPD

### 7. Endotracheal Intubation & Invasive Ventilation?
- **Indications**: patients with respiratory failure (hypoxia, hypercapnia) who fail to improve despite CPAP or NIPPV, physical exhaustion, diminished level of consciousness and inability to maintain and protect the airway

### 8. Blood Tests
- Plasma natriuretic peptide level (BNP, NT-proBNP or MR-proANP) should be measured in all patients with suspected acute heart failure
- Troponin measurement recommended. High sensitivity troponin levels usually elevated

### 9. Cause-Specific Therapy?
- STEMI / NSTEMI? See STEMI
- Structural problem (e.g. papillary muscle rupture)? Consider urgent thoracic surgery

### 10. Admission & Monitoring
- ICU admission if SaO₂ < 90% despite supplemental O₂, heart rate < 60 or >120 bpm, SBP < 90 mm Hg, evidence of organ hypoperfusion (e.g. diminished urine output, altered mental status)
- Loop diuretics: total IV daily dose 2.5 times the patient's previous total oral dose, administered every 12 hours. If diuretic response is inadequate, addition of metolazone
- Monitor blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse, daily weights, urinary output, renal function, potassium. Consider Bladder Catheterization
- Na & fluid restriction (< 2g/day, < 2 L/day), LMWH for thromboembolic prophylaxis

### Bedside Chest X-ray?
- Bedside chest X-ray may help rule out other causes of dyspnea and rule-in pulmonary edema, although the CXR may be normal in nearly 20% of patients with acute heart failure

# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbation

## INTRODUCTION
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic airflow obstruction caused by small airway disease (obstructive bronchiolitis) and/or parenchymal destruction (emphysema). A COPD exacerbation is defined as "an acute event characterized by a worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variations and leads to a change in medication." (GOLD 2015)

## CONTEXT
- Patient risk factors are known COPD and smoking history.
- Patients with COPD exacerbations present with an acute change in ≥ 1 of the following:
 - **increased cough** frequency or severity
 - **increased sputum** volume and/or change in character
 - **increased dyspnea**

## ABCDE
| Section | Findings |
|---------|----------|
| A | **Central cyanosis** may be present |
| B | **Decreased SpO₂%**<br>**Tachypnea, prolonged expiratory phase**<br>**Decreased breath sounds** on auscultation, expiratory wheeze<br>**Accessory respiratory muscle use, Hoover's sign** (abdominal wall retracts on insp.) |
| C | **Tachycardia** |
| D | **Altered mental status** (confusion, lethargy, coma) is an indication for ICU admission. |

## BEDSIDE TESTS
| Test | Findings |
|------|----------|
| BBT | **Respiratory acidosis**: pH < 7.25 despite non-invasive ventilation is an indication for ICU admission.<br>**Polycythemia** (hematocrit > 55%) may be present in patients with chronic hypoxia. |
| EKG | **Right atrial hypertrophy** may be present in the COPD patient with long-standing pulmonary hypertension. |
| US | Ultrasound is mainly valuable to rule out alternative causes of dyspnea, e.g. pulmonary edema (B-lines), pleural fluid, consolidation (pneumonia), pneumothorax |

## MANAGEMENT

### 1. Oxygen Therapy?
- **Indication**: SpO₂ < 90%, hypoxia
- Oxygen via nasal canula, Venturia mask or facemask, titrated to a target SpO₂ of 88-92%

### 2. Short-Acting Bronchodilators
- **Indication**: short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists and short-acting anticholinergic agents are recommended despite absence of randomized controlled trials
- Salbutamol (Ventoline®) 5 mg nebulized q4h
- Ipratropium (Atrovent®) 0.5 mg nebulized q4h

### 3. Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation?
- **Indications**: NIPPV reduces the need for endotracheal intubation and mortality in patients with COPD exacerbations. Indications for NIPPV:
 - Respiratory acidosis (arterial pH ≤ 7.35 and/or PaCO₂ ≥ 6.0 kPa [45 mm Hg])
 - Severe dyspnea with clinical signs suggestive of respiratory muscle fatigue and/or increased work of breathing (e.g. use of respiratory accessory muscles, paradoxical motion of the abdomen, or retraction of the intercostal spaces)
- **Contraindications**: absolute contraindications for NIPPV are cardiac and respiratory arrest. Relative contraindications include:
 - a high risk of aspiration because of impaired mental status (except when the impairment is due to hypercapnia)
 - a large volume of secretions
 - recurrent vomiting
 - recent upper-airway or upper gastrointestinal surgery
- IPAP of 10 cm water & EPAP of 5 cm of water are standard initial settings
- CPAP (continuous positive-airway pressure) does not directly support ventilation, but it may indirectly improve ventilation through alveolar recruitment

### 4. Endotracheal Intubation?
- **Indications** for endotracheal intubation include:
 - Airway: massive aspiration
 - Breathing: life-threatening hypoxemia, respiratory pauses or arrest
 - Circulation: severe hemodynamic instability without response to fluids and vasoactive drugs, heart rate < 50 bpm with loss of alertness, life-threatening arrhythmias
 - Disability: diminished consciousness, psychomotor agitation inadequately controlled by sedation
 - Inability to tolerate NIPPV or NIPPV failure

### 5. Corticosteroids
- **Indication**: reduce treatment failure and length of hospital stay in COPD exacerbations
- Prednisolone 40 mg PO daily (corresponds to Betamethasone 5 mg) for 5 days

### 6. Antibiotics?
- **Indication**: increased sputum purulence + (increased sputum volume or increased dyspnea). Antibiotic choice based on local bacterial resistance patterns
- Doxyferm® 200 mg PO or Amimox® 750 mg PO are 1st line medications in Sweden
- Sputum cultures are recommended for patients with frequent exacerbations, severe airflow limitation, and/or exacerbations required mechanical ventilation

### 7. Admission?
- **Indications for ICU admission** include:
 - Severe dyspnea that responds inadequately to initial emergency therapy
 - Persistent or worsening hypoxemia (PaO₂ ≤ 5.3 kPa [40 mm Hg]) despite supplemental oxygen and noninvasive ventilation
 - Severe or worsening respiratory acidosis (pH < 7.25) despite noninvasive ventilation
 - Need for invasive mechanical ventilation
 - Hemodynamic instability-need for vasopressors
 - Changes in mental status (confusion, lethargy, coma)

# Pneumonia

## INTRODUCTION
- Pneumonia refers to an infection of the pulmonary parenchyma
- Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) refers to pneumonia acquired in the community
- Hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) refers to pneumonia acquired in the hospital

## CONTEXT
- Risk factors include extremes of age (in particular > 65 years), immunosuppression, dementia. COPD increases the risk of hospitalization from CAP
- Presentation: cough (with or without sputum production), fever, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain. Symptoms are less commonly reported by older patients with pneumonia

## ABCDE
| Section | Findings |
|---------|----------|
| B | **Resp rate ≥ 25/min** in 45-70% of cases, may be most sensitive sign in older adults<br>**Low SpO₂** may be present<br>**Crackles** are present in most patients. Other auscultatory findings include decreased breath sounds, bronchial breathing, egophony |
| C | **Tachycardia** is common |
| D | **Mental status changes** are common in the elderly |
| E | **Fever** is present in 80% of cases but may be absent, especially in older patients |

## BEDSIDE TESTS
| Test | Findings |
|------|----------|
| US | SN > 90% & SP > 90%. Presumably out-performs initial chest x-ray.<br>Consolidation, focal interstitial pattern, subpleural lesion, pleural-line abnormalities |

# Tachycardia

## 1. ABCDE
The first step in the management of patients with tachycardia is to carry out the ABCDE:
- it ensures that the patient receives acute treatment such as oxygen
- it allows the physician to determine whether the patient is hemodynamically compromised
- it yields diagnostic clues as to the cause of the tachycardia

## 2. Is Urgent Cardioversion Indicated?
Urgent electrical cardioversion is indicated in patients who fulfill the following two criteria:
- **Hemodynamic compromised**. There are no clear-cut criteria. Signs and symptoms suggesting hemodynamic compromise include severe shortness of breath, hypoxia, crackles on pulmonary auscultation, hypotension, decreased level of consciousness
- **Non-sinus tachycardia**. VT is the typical arrhythmia that warrants urgent cardioversion when the patient is hypoperfused. On the other hand, urgent cardioversion is not warranted when the tachycardia is a sinus tachycardia secondary to severe sepsis in a patient with a preexisting bundle branch block

If urgent cardioversion is indicated, the following steps are carried out:
1. Place the defibrillator pads on the patient's chest
2. Press on the synchronization button
3. Sedate, e.g. Propofol 0.5 mg/kg IV or Midazolam 2 mg IV + Ketamine 30 mg IV
4. Deliver a first shock: 150 J biphasic for adults, 1 J/kg for children
5. If additional shocks are necessary, the synchronization button should be pushed on prior to each additional shock since defibrillators revert to the unsynchronized mode after each shock. 200 J is a suitable charge for adults while 2 J/kg is a suitable charge for children.
6. Up to three attempts
7. If cardioversion fails to restore sinus rhythm and the patient remains unstable, give Amiodarone 50 mg/ml 6 ml (300 mg) in Glucose 50 mg/ml 100 ml IV over 15 min and reattempt cardioversion
8. If the patient becomes unconscious and ceases to breath normally, cardiac arrest has occurred and A-CPR should be initiated

## 3. Bedside Tests
| Test | Findings |
|------|----------|
| BBT | - **Hyperkalemia** may cause wide QRS complexes; a supraventricular tachycardia with wide QRS complexes may be mistaken for VT<br>- **Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia** may lead to torsade de pointe by prolonging the QTc |
| EKG | - A **12-lead EKG** yields valuable diagnostic information and should be acquired in all patients with tachycardia, with the possible exception of patients who need urgent cardioversion |

## 4. Consider Precipitants
### Tachycardia Precipitants
| Pathophysiology | Examples |
|----------------|-----------|
| Vascular | - Hypovolemic shock, e.g. bleeding<br>- Obstructive shock, e.g. pulmonary embolism<br>- Myocardial pathology, e.g. ischemia<br>- Distributive shock, e.g. sepsis |
| Infectious | - Pneumonia<br>- Urinary tract infection<br>- Exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder |
| Toxic | - Digoxin intoxication<br>- Antiarrhythmic medications<br>- Cocain and amphetamine intoxications<br>- Alcohol abstinence |
| Metabolic | - Hypoxia<br>- Thyrotoxicosis<br>- Electrolyte abnormalities, e.g. hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia |

## 5. Further Management
Categorizing the tachycardia according to regularity and QRS width narrows the differential diagnosis and guides further management

### Differential Diagnosis of Tachycardia
| QRS Duration | Regular | Irregular |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| QRS < 120 msec | - Sinus tachycardia<br>- MRAT (e.g. atrial flutter)<br>- EAT (Ectopic Atrial Tachycardia)<br>- AVNRT<br>- AVRT, orthodromic | - AF (Atrial Fibrillation)<br>- MRAT + varying AV block<br>- EAT + varying AV block<br>- MAT (Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia) |
| QRS ≥ 120 msec | - VT (Ventricular Tachycardia), monomorphic<br>- Sinus tachycardia, MRAT, EAT, AVNRT with:<br>  - Bundle branch block<br>  - Accessory pathway<br>  - Membrane stabilisation (intoxication, hyperkalemia)<br>- AVRT, antidromic | - VT, polymorphic (e.g. torsade de pointes) or monomorphic<br>- AF, MAT, or MRAT/EAT with varying AV-block +<br>  - Bundle branch block<br>  - Accessory pathway<br>  - Membrane stabilisation (intoxication, hyperkalemia) |

MRAT: macro-re-entrant atrial tachycardia  
AVNRT: atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia  
AVRT: atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia

### Of Note
- High septal VT can have a QRS-width of 110-120 msec
- While monomorphic VTs are as rule regular, they can be irregular:
 - during the first 30 seconds of onset
 - in patients treated with antiarrhythmic drugs
 - with focal idiopathic VT

# Regular Tachycardias with Narrow QRS Complexes

## EKG Findings Interpretation
| Findings | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| 2 P waves for each R wave | - Atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction |
| RP < 70 msec | - AVNRT |
| RP > 70 msec and RP < PR | - AVRT, orthodromic |
| RP > PR | - Atrial tachycardia or sinus tachycardia |

## 1. 12-lead EKG
The 12-lead EKG may yield valuable diagnostic information regarding the electrophysiologic mechanism underlying the tachycardia.

| Arrhythmia | Findings |
|------------|-----------|
| Sinus tachycardia | - The EKG shows a P wave preceding each QRS. The P wave is upright in lead II.<br>- Several formulas have been proposed to estimate the maximal rate of sinus tachycardia in healthy adults, e.g. 208 - (0.7 x age) bpm. |
| Atrial flutter | - The rate of atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction across the atrioventricular (AV) node is typically around 150 bpm. In some cases, 1:1 conduction across the AV node may occur.<br>- Flutter waves, generating a "sawtooth pattern", can sometimes be seen on the 12-lead EKG. Otherwise, they can be revealed by administering adenosine. |
| AVNRT | - A retrograde P wave may occasionally be seen on the 12-lead EKG, with an RP time < 70 msec (see below). |
| AVRT, orthodromic | - A retrograde P wave may occasionally be seen on the 12-lead EKG.<br>- A prior EKG when the patient was in sinus rhythm may reveal a delta wave, which corresponds to preexcitation of the ventricle through the accessory pathway. |
| Ectopic atrial tachycardia | - The axis of the P wave may be aberrant, e.g. negative in lead II.<br>- The PR interval may be shorter or longer than usual. |

## 2. Consider Esophageal EKG or Lewis (S5) Lead
P waves may be hard to identify on the 12-lead EKG during a tachycardia since they may be masked by the QRS complex or superimposed on the T wave. An esophageal EKG or the use of the Lewis lead can help identify P waves and the temporal relationship between atrial depolarization and ventricular depolarization.

The esophageal electrode is inserted similarly to a nasogastric tube. The electrode is slowly drawn out of the stomach until a distinct signal corresponding to the activation of the right atrium is obtained (P wave). The RP refers to interval between the activation of the ventricle (R wave) and the activation of the atrium (P wave) whereas the PR refers to the interval between the P wave and the subsequent R wave.

The Lewis Lead (S5 lead) is obtained in the following manner:
- The Right Arm electrode is placed on the 2nd intercostal space, right sternal border
- The Left Arm electrode is placed on the 4th intercostal space, right sternal border
- The amplitude is increased to 20 mm/mV

## 3. Further Management

### Sinus Tachycardia
Further management involves identifying and managing the cause of the tachycardia. See Tachycardia, 4. Consider Precipitants.

### Atrial Flutter
Further management is identical to that of atrial fibrillation (see Irregular Tachycardia with Narrow QRS Complexes). Treatment with Adenosine may reveal the flutter waves and help establish the cause of the tachycardia, but it does not help terminate the arrhythmia. If electrical cardioversion is carried out, the recommended initial energy is 70-120 J biphasic.

### AVNRT & AVRT
The reentry mechanism can be interrupted at the level of the AV node in a number of ways:
- **Modified Valsalva Maneuver**: the patient, in the semi-recumbent position, blows into a 20 ml syringe with enough force to push back the plunger. Immediately after the strain, the patient is laid flat and has his/her legs raised to 45° for 15 sec.
- **Other non-pharmacological methods**: placing a rubber glove filled with ice-cold water on the bridge of the nose; carotid sinus massage (contraindicated if there is a risk of stroke due to carotid artery disease).
- **Adenosine**: In adults, the starting dose is 5 mg and subsequent doses are 10 and 15 mg. Adenosine should be administered as a bolus followed by a saline flush given its extremely short half-life. In children, recommended doses are 0.1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg; the maximum single dose is 0.5 mg/kg (0.3 mg/kg in a child < 1 month).
- **Diltiazem**: In adults, the dose is 0.25mg/kg IV followed by 0.35mg/kg if conversion not achieved.
- **Verapamil**: In adults, the starting dose is 5-10 mg given IV over 2 minutes. In the absence of response, an additional 10 mg can be given IV 15-30 min after the first dose.
- **Amiodarone** 300 mg in glucose 50 mg/ml over 10-60 min IV is also indicated for Paroxysmal SVT uncontrolled by adenosine or vagal manoeuvres.
- **Electrical cardioversion** with a recommended initial energy 70-120 J biphasic.

Following cardioversion, patients may be referred to a cardiologist for consideration of catheter ablation.

### Ectopic Atrial Tachycardia
Consult a cardiologist.

# Regular Tachycardias with Wide QRS Complexes

## 1. Cardiac Arrest?
- Defibrillate (asynchronous) 200 J (4 J/kg). See Cardiac Arrest

## 2. Urgent Cardioversion?
- If the patient is hemodynamically unstable, prepare for cardioversion. See Tachycardia

## 3. 12-Lead EKG
Looking at the 12-lead EKG and comparing it with previous EKGs may help distinguish between the different causes of a wide QRS complex tachycardia.

| Rhythm | Findings |
|--------|-----------|
| VT | - **A for Axis**: extreme axis deviation (QRS negative in leads I and II, "northwest axis") suggests VT<br>- **B for Broad**: QRS ≥ 160 msec is strongly associated with VT but may also occur in the presence of class I antiarrhythmics and preexcitation<br>- **C for Concordance**: Negative concordance (all the QRS complexes in V1-V6 are negative) is virtually diagnostic of VT generated from the anteroapical left ventricle. Positive concordance (all the QRS complexes in V1-V6 are positive) suggests VT generated from the posterobasal LV, but may occur with a posterior bypass tract. Absence of RS complexes in all precordial leads, i.e. all QRS-complexes are monophasic R waves or monophasic S waves, suggests VT.<br>- **D for Dissociation**: AV dissociation manifested as P waves not temporally associated with the QRS complexes is diagnostic of VT. Capture beats (occasional small QRS complexes) and fusion beats (half-widened QRS complexes) occur when the ventricles are depolarized through the His-Purkinje system. Capture beats and fusion beats are signs of AV dissociation and are pathognomonic for VT<br>- **E for Early Wide**: RS complex > 100 msec (time from onset of the R wave to nadir of the S wave) in any precordial lead suggests VT. RWPT ≥ 50 msec in lead II (R Wave to Peak Time) is the time from the onset of the QRS to the first change in polarity (either peak of the R wave or nadir of the Q wave). One study found this criterion associated with VT LR+ 35<br>- **F for Fragmentation**: Josephson sign (notch at the bottom of S wave in V1 or V2) suggests VT |
| SVT with aberrancy | - If the 12-lead EKG shows a typical bundle branch block pattern that was present on previous EKGs, SVT with a bundle branch block is likely.<br>- SVT with hyperkalemia or membrane stabilization should be considered when the heart rate is < 130 bpm<br>- Ashman's phenomenon refers to the occurrence of wide complexes due to an intermittent bundle branch block. The aberrant conduction is preceded by a long RR interval followed by a short RR interval. |
| AVRT, antidromic | - This tachyarrhythmia can be difficult to distinguish from VT without an electrophysiological study.<br>- A prior EKG when the patient was in sinus rhythm may reveal a delta wave, which corresponds to preexcitation of the ventricle through the accessory pathway. |

## 4. Consider Esophageal EKG or Lewis (S5) Lead
P waves may be hard to identify during a tachycardia since they may be masked by a QRS complex or superimposed on the T wave. An esophageal EKG or the use of the Lewis Lead (see Regular Tachycardias with Narrow QRS Complexes) can reveal the temporal relationship between atrial depolarization and ventricular depolarization:
- In the setting of VT, the esophageal EKG reveals no relationship between P and R waves
- In the settings of SVT with abberrancy or AVRT, a 1:1 relationship between atrial activity and ventricular activity is present

## 5. Hyperkalemia?
- Hyperkalemia can lead to wide QRS complexes, and in this setting, treament with class I or class III antiarrhythmics can be fatal. See Hyperkalemia for management

## 6. Sodium Channel Blockade?
- Poisoning with a substance that blocks fast sodium channels can lead to wide QRS complexes, and in this setting, treament with class I or class III antiarrhythmics can be fatal. See Sodium Channel Blockade Toxidrome for management

## 7. Ventricular Tachycardia?
- Hemodynamically stable adult patients with ventricular tachycardia can be treated with Amiodarone 300 mg in glucose 50 mg/ml IV over 20–60 min, followed by an infusion of 900 mg over 24 h in adults. In children, the recommended amiodarone dose is 5 mg/kg IV over 20–60 min.
- Hypomagnesemia is often associated with hypokalemia. If ventricular tachycardia arises in the setting of hypokalemia, administer Magnesium Sulphate 2 g = 8 mmol (Addex®-Magnesium 1 mmol/ml 8 ml) IV over 2 min. The dose may be repeated after 10-15 min.
- Synchronized cardioversion should be considered if pharmaceutical cardioversion is unsuccessful. The recommended initial energy is 120-150 J biphasic.

## 8. SVT with aberrancy & AVRT, antidromic?
- See Regular Tachycardias with Narrow QRS Complexes

# Irregular Tachycardias with Narrow QRS Complexes

## 1. 12-Lead EKG

| Arrhythmia | Findings |
|------------|-----------|
| Atrial fibrillation | • The EKG reveals an irregularly irregular tachycardia with small QRS complexes and no apparent P waves |
| Atrial flutter | • Variable AV block leads to an irregular rhythm, at times around 150 bpm (2:1 conduction) and at times around 100 bpm (3:1 conduction).<br>• The flutter waves (with a typical rate of 300 bpm) can sometimes be seen on the 12-lead EKG, or revealed by administering adenosine. |
| Ectopic atrial tachycardia<br>MAT* | • Variable AV block leads to an irregular rhythm. The baseline rate of EAT is usually 130 - 250 bpm<br>• By definition, there are ≥ 3 different P wave morphologies and variable PR intervals. *MAT = Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia |

*The management of MAT consists mainly in treating the underlying disease. The rest of this section focuses on the management of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (AF).*

## 2. Rhythm Control, Rate Control or Neither?

**Patients with AF and Acute Medical Condition**<br>
Patients with AF and an acute medical condition (e.g. sepsis, acute coronary syndrome, acute decompensated heart failure, pulmonary embolism, COPD exacerbation, GI bleeding) fare *worse* with active rate/rhythm control measure. Focus on treating the underlying condition.

### Rhythm Control Options

| Situation | Therapeutic Options |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Both of the following:<br>• AF < 48 hrs or therapeutic OAC > 3 weeks<br>• Absence of high-risk factors* | • Pharmacologic cardioversion if no contraindications<br>• Electrical cardioversion |
| One of the following:<br>• AF ≥ 48 hrs or uncertain duration and no therapeutic OAC > 3 weeks<br>• ≥ 1 high-risk factor* | • TEE; if no thrombi, electrical cardioversion then OAC for 4 weeks.<br>• OAC for 3 weeks, then electrical cardioversion, then OAC for 4 weeks. |

\* High-risk factors include: recent stroke or TIA within 6 months, rheumatic heart disease, mechanical valve. TEE = Transesophageal echocardiography. OAC = Oral Anticoagulation.

### Pharmacologic Cardioversion
Vernakalant (Brinavess®) IV converts 50-60% of patients with a median time to conversion of 8-11 min. Vernakalant is administered as a 10-minute infusion of 3 mg/kg and, if AF persists after 15 minutes, a second infusion of 2 mg/kg is given. Contraindications:
- NYHA III or NYHA IV heart failure
- Coronary syndrome within the past 30 days
- Severe aortic stenosis
- SBP < 100 mm Hg
- Uncorrected QT-interval > 440 ms (QTc interval > 500 ms)
- Severe bradycardia, sinus nodal dysfunction, AV block II or III in the absence of pacemaker
- Antiarrhythmic class I or class III within the past 4 hours
- Allergy to the active substance or adjuvant

# Electrical Cardioversion
90% success rate. Sedation with Propofol 0.5-1 mg/kg (lower dose for older patients). Use maximum defibrillator output.

# Rate Control
- Beta-blockers (e.g. Metoprolol 5 mg IV) in the absence of acute cardiac failure, severe bronchospasm. Low-dose if LVEF < 40%, signs and symptoms of cardiac failure
- Digoxin (0.5 mg initial dose IV) as second line therapy.
- Amiodarone (300 mg in 250 ml 5% dextrose IV over 30-60 min) for critical patients with hemodynamic instability, or as adjunct if no success with beta-blockers + digoxin, or instead of beta-blocker in a patient with haemodynamic instability and severely reduced LVEF.

# 3. Anticoagulation?

# Irregular Tachycardias with Wide QRS Complexes

## 1. 12-Lead EKG
Examination of the 12-lead EKG and previous EKGs may help distinguish between the different causes of irregular, wide complex tachycardias.

| Arrhythmia | Findings |
|------------|-----------|
| VT, polymorphic | • Polymorphic VTs have continuously varying QRS complex morphology and/or axis.<br>• In Torsade de Pointes (TdP), the peaks of the QRS complexes appear to "twist" around the isoelectric baseline |
| Atrial fibrillation with bundle branch block | • The EKG reveals an irregular rhythm with wide QRS complexes consistent with a right or left bundle branch block.<br>• A previous EKG in sinus rhythm shows a bundle branch block with the same QRS morphology. |
| Atrial fibrillation with WPW | • The rhythm is irregularly irregular. Occasional small QRS complexes occur, often in pairs or triplets, a phenomenon referred to as 'coupling'.<br>• An irregular wide complex tachycardia with a frequency of > 220 bpm is pathognomonic for preexcited atrial fibrillation. |

## 2. Further Management

**Polymorphic VT**
• Polymorphic VT is generally an unstable rhythm requiring prompt electrical cardioversion. The defibrillator may have trouble identifying the QRS complexes; if synchronized cardioversion is not possible, asynchronized cardioversion is recommended.

**Torsade de Pointes**
• Sustained TdP leads to loss of consciousness within 15-45 seconds and can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. Under these circumstances, the patient should be treated as per the cardiac arrest protocol with defibrillation. Torsade de pointes usually is not sustained, in which case the following treatment apply.

• **Atropine** 1 mg IV followed by **Isoprenaline infusion** 0.05 μg/kg/min are indicated if the baseline rate (between episodes of TdP) is < 60 bpm. The Isoprenaline infusion is titrated to reach a heart rate > 80 bpm. Isoprenaline 0.2 mg/ml 25 ml are mixed with Glucose 50 mg/ml 500 ml yielding a 10 μg/ml solution. An infusion rate of 20 ml/hr, i.e. 3 μg/min, corresponds to 0.05 μg/kg/min for a 60 kg patient.

• **Magnesium** may shorten the QTc even in patients with normal Mg²⁺ serum levels and suppress the ventricular premature beats that trigger the arrhythmia. In adults, add 8 ml of Addex Magnesium 1 mmol/ml (2 g) to 100 ml of Glucose 50 mg/ml and administer over 10 minutes. In children, the bolus dose is 25-50 mg/kg. Another source recommends 10-15 mmol Magnesium IV over 2 minutes followed by an infusion of 6 mmol/hr during 12 hours. The magnesium level should be checked every 6 hours and not exceed 2 mmol/L.

• **Potassium** (max 20 mmol/hr) should be given to target a potassium level of 4.5-5 mmol/L.

• **Transvenous 'overdrive' heart pacing** is another option.

Here's the markdown transcription of the medical document:

# Atrial Fibrillation with Woff-Parkinson-White

- **Ibutilide** (Corvert®) is the drug of choice in this setting. It is given at a dosage of 1 mg (0.01 mg/kg for patients < 60 kg) over 10 minutes IV and can be repeated once after a 10-minute period.
- **Electrical cardioversion** is recommended if pharmacological cardioversion with ibutilide is unsuccessful or if ibutilide is unavailable.
- **Admission** to a ward with heart monitoring for ablation is recommended for all patients with atrial fibrillation and WPW.

**NOTE:** Medications (and maneuvers such as Valsalva) that impair conduction through the AV node may enhance conduction down the accessory pathway, leading to very rapid ventricular response, severe hypotension or cardiac arrest. For these reasons, beta-blockers, digitalis, calcium channel blockers and adenosine are **contraindicated** in the setting of atrial fibrillation with WPW. Amiodarone is also **contraindicated** since it may increase the ventricular rate and result in VF.

# Atrial Fibrillation with Bundle Branch Block, Hyperkalemia, Sodium Channel Blockade Toxicity

- The management of atrial fibrillation (with or without bundle branch block) is covered in the section *Irregular Tachycardia with Narrow QRS Complexes*
- The management of hyperkalemia is covered in the section *Hyperkalemia*.
- The management of poisoning with a substance that blocks fast sodium channels is covered in the section *Sodium Channel Blockade Toxidrome*.

# Hypotension / Shock

## INTRODUCTION
Shock is a condition resulting from insufficient oxygen delivery to the vital organs relative to their metabolic demands.

## ABCDE
| A | • Stridor and tongue swelling suggest anaphylaxis. |
|---|---|
| B | • Low SpO₂ suggests pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary edema, anaphylaxis.<br>• Decreased pulmonary auscultatory findings suggest pleural fluid or pneumothorax.<br>• Wheezes suggest anaphylaxis, pulmonary edema<br>• Ronchi suggest pneumonia, pulmonary edema |
| C | • Hypotension may be present but the blood pressure can also be normal<br>• Tachycardia may be present secondary to shock or as a cause of shock. Tachycardia is not necessarily present in hemorrhagic shock.<br>• Wide QRS complex suggests ventricular tachycardia, hyperkalemia, poisoning with sodium channel blocker, myocardial ischemia, pulmonary embolism (PE). |
| D | • Altered mental status may be present.<br>• Horner's syndrome, paraparesis or tetraparesis suggest neurogenic shock. |
| E | • Warm extremities may be present in distributive shock<br>• Cold, pale, clammy extremities suggest peripheral vasoconstriction<br>• Fever suggests sepsis but may also be present in adrenal crisis, massive PE<br>• Hypothermia may be present in cases of severe shock including sepsis. |

## BEDSIDE TESTS
| Test | Findings |
|---|---|
| BBT | • Lactate > 4 mmol/L and BE ≤-6 mmol/L suggest shock<br>• Anemia suggests hemorrhagic shock, yet Hb may be normal in acute blood loss |
| EKG | • AV block suggests myocardial ischemia or poisoning with beta-blockers, calcium antagonists or digoxin.<br>• Wide QRS may suggest bundle branch block caused by ischemia, hyperkalemi, intoxication with a sodium channel blocker, massive pulmonary embolism<br>• ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities may suggest ischemia<br>• Negative T-waves in V1-V4 + in lead III suggest RV strain, e.g. massive PE |
| US | • Pericardial fluid with right ventricular collapse during diastole suggests tamponade<br>• Enlarged right ventricular and an intraventricular septum that is straight or bulging into the left ventricle suggests massive pulmonary embolism.<br>• Poor left ventricular contractility suggests cardiogenic shock.<br>• Inferior vena cava > 2 cm in diameter and collapsing < 50% upon inspiration correlates with a CVP > 10 cm H₂O and suggests obstructive or cardiogenic shock.<br>• Inferior vena cava < 2 cm in diameter and collapsing > 50% upon inspiration correlates with a CVP < 10 cm H₂O and suggests hypovolemic or distributive shock.<br>• AAA > 5 cm + shock suggests rupture<br>• Free fluid + shock suggests hemorrhagic shock |

# MANAGEMENT

1. **Ringer Bolus**
- Warm Ringer's Acetate 500 ml (10 ml/kg) can be justified as initial therapy in the setting of hypotension of unclear origin regardless of its cause to determine "fluid responsiveness."
- Large bore catheters x 2. Resistance is proportional to the inverse of the diameter raised to the fourth power. Central lines not necessarily better than large bore PVCs.
- Intraosseous needle is a rapid alternative to a peripheral venous catheter.

2. **Adrenalin?**
- Adrenalin as push-dose pressor is justifiable in the setting of severe shock (SBP < 70 mm Hg, no radial pulse) as a bridge to cause-directed therapy or to vasopressor infusion
- Adrenalin 1 mg/ml 0.5 ml IM is first line therapy for anaphylaxis and regarded as safe
- Adrenalin 0.1 mg/ml 1 ml diluted with 9 ml NaCl in a 10 ml syringe yields a 10 μg/ml solution. Administer 1-2 ml IV slowly (push-dose pressor)

3. **12-Lead EKG**
- Ischemic ST-T changes may suggest cardiogenic shock secondary to acute coronary syndrome
- Tachyarrhythmia may be the cause or the consequence of shock
- Bradyarrhythmia may be the cause of shock, a manifestation of a poisoning, or indicative of pre-arrest

4. **Bedside Blood and Urine Tests**
- Anemia may suggest hemorrhagic shock, but a normal Hb may be present in acute hemorrhage
- Hyperkalemia and hyponatremia may suggest Addison crisis
- Elevated lactate, decreased base excess and bicarbonate are indicative of shock
- Capillary CRP has uncertain value in distinguishing between infectious and non-infectious causes of shock.
- Urine beta-hCG, when positive in a fertile woman in shock, suggests ruptured ectopic pregnancy.

5. **Ultrasound Heart**
- Tamponade is suggested by pericardial fluid with RA collapse during early systole and RV collapse during early diastole. Tamponade may be secondary to structural problems such as aortic dissection, free wall rupture.
- Right ventricular enlargement, flattened septum (D-sign on PSA) suggest pulmonary hypertension, e.g. from a pulmonary embolism or chronic lung disease
- Valvulopathy of sudden onset may result in cardiogenic shock

6. **Ultrasound IVC**
- Flat IVC suggests hypovolemic or distributive shock
- Full IVC suggests obstructive or cardiogenic shock

7. **Ultrasound Perihepatic + Perisplenic**
- Pleural fluid may suggest hemothorax
- Intraperitoneal fluid may suggest hemorrhage, e.g. secondary to rupture ectopic pregnancy
- Hydronephrosis in the setting of sepsis may suggest obstructive pyelonephritis

### 8. Ultrasound Abdominal Aorta
- AAA in the setting of shock suggests ruptured AAA. A retroperitoneal rupture does not lead to intraperitoneal fluid

### 9. Ultrasound Lung
- Absent lung sliding suggests pneumothorax but may occur in other conditions. Lung-point is diagnostic but will be absent if the whole lung is collapsed
- B-lines bilaterally are suggestive of pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock

### 10. Additional Tests
- WBC, thrombocytes, aPTT & INR are routinely measured in patients with shock
- Troponin if cardiac ischemia is a possibility
- Bladder catheterization to accurately follow urinary output

### 11. Prevent Hypothermia
- The "lethal triad" consists of the self-perpetuation combination of hypothermia, acidosis and coagulopathy. Hypothermia should be prevented through the administration of warm fluids, removal of wet clothes etc.

### 12. Further Management
- Further management depends on the suspected cause or causes of shock.
- Initial vasopressor: Noradrenalin 1 mg/ml 2 ml in 48 ml saline = 40 μg/ml
- Initial infusion 0.1 μg/kg/min. Bolus 5-10 μg

### Differential Diagnosis of Hypotension / Shock

| Type | Conditions |
|------|------------|
| Hypovolemic | • Hemorrhagic shock<br>• Intravascular volume depletion (e.g. diuretics, diarrhea) |
| Obstructive | • Massive pulmonary embolism<br>• Cardiac tamponade<br>• Tension pneumothorax<br>• Breath stacking in a patient with asthma<br>• Vena cava syndrome in third trimester pregnancy |
| Cardiogenic | • Ischemia<br>• Structural problems e.g. papillary muscle rupture, free wall rupture<br>• Arrhythmia e.g. tachyarrhythmias, hyperkaliemia<br>• Poisoning e.g. with beta-blockers, calcium antagonists<br>• Cardiomyopathy |
| Distributive | • Iatrogenic<br>• Sepsis, severe pancreatitis, vasodilators<br>• Anaphylaxis, transfusion reaction<br>• Neurogenic shock<br>• Adrenal crisis |
| Dissociative | • Carbon monoxide poisoning<br>• Cyanide poisoning<br>• Methemoglobinemia |

# Hypovolemic Shock

## INTRODUCTION
Hypovolemia refers to a condition in which effective circulating volume (ECV) is reduced. Reduced ECV leads to reduced preload and cardiac output. Hypovolemia can result from salt and water losses (e.g. due to diarrhea) or from water losses alone (e.g. due to diabetes insipidus).

Dehydration refers to reduced total body water content, of which two thirds are intracellular fluid. Dehydration is the most common cause of hypovolemic shock, yet a patient may be dehydrated and not in shock, and vice-versa. Much of the clinical literature uses the terms hypovolemia and dehydration interchangeably. The degree of volume depletion can be categorized according to loss of body weight:

• mild dehydration: 3-5% weight loss<br>
• moderate dehydration: 6-10% weight loss<br>
• severe dehydration: > 10% weight loss

## ABCDE

| A | • Moist mucous membranes argue against hypovolemia in general LR 0.3 and among children LR 0.41.<br>• Tongue without furrows argue against hypovolemia LR 0.3.<br>• Sunken eyes are weekly associated with 5% dehydration in children SN 75% SP 52% LR+ 1.7 LR- 0.49<br>• Sunken fontanelles are present with severe dehydration in infants. |
|---|---|
| B | • Tachypnea accompanies many pediatric illnesses and may be a compensation for metabolic acidosis. Tachypnea contributes to insensible fluid loss.<br>• Abnormal respiratory pattern (e.g. deep rapid breathing without other signs of respiratory distress) is associated with 5% dehydration in children SN 43% SP 79% LR+ 2.0 LR- 0.76 |
| C | • Weak peripheral pulses result from peripheral vasoconstriction<br>• Orthostatic falls in blood pressure occur with moderate (6-10%) volume loss.<br>• Hypotension is a late and ominous sign.<br>• Tachycardia from the body's attempt to increase cardiac output; non-specific finding. |
| D | • Irritability may initially be present.<br>• Lethargy develops as shock evolves. |
| E | • Capillary refill time (CRT) measurement is another surrogate assessment of perfusion. CRT may be measured peripherally or centrally.<br>• Peripheral CRT: pressure on the palmar surface of the distal fingertip with the arm at the level of the heart in a warm ambient temperature. A prolonged peripheral CRT (> 2 seconds) in children is associated with 5% dehydration SN 60% SP 85% LR+ 4.1.<br>• Central CRT is obtained by pressing on the sternum or forehead instead. A CRT > 2 seconds is again considered to be pathological. The central CRT is said to be more specific but less sensitive for early shock than the peripheral capillary refill time.<br>• CRT in adults is of questionable value.<br>• Abnormal skin turgor was associated with 5% dehydration in children SN 58%, SP 76%, LR+ 2.5 LR- 0.66. Abnormal skin turgor has no proven value in adults.<br>• Dry axilla supports the diagnosis of hypovolemia LR+ 2.8. |

• Fever accompanies many pediatric illnesses.
• Cool distal extremities result from peripheral vasoconstriction.

**MANAGEMENT**

**1. Isotonic Crystalloid Bolus for Severe Dehydration - Shock**
• **Isotonic crystalloid** (e.g. 0.9% sodium chloride or Ringer's acetate) intravenous therapy is warranted in the setting of severe dehydration - shock. A systematic review failed to show any mortality benefit from resuscitation with colloids instead of crystalloids in critically ill patients requiring volume replacement due to losses resulting from trauma, burns or following surgery.

• **Children:** 20 ml/kg IV bolus is recommended. A second fluid bolus is administered if signs of shock persist after the first bolus. The presence of hypo- or hypernatremia does not affect the choice of fluids at this stage.

• **Adults:** 500-1,000 ml IV bolus is appropriate, depending on the presence of comorbidities such as heart failure.

**2. Oral vs Intravenous Rehydration Therapy for Mild - Moderate Dehydration**
• **Oral rehydration therapy** is the treatment of choice for mild-moderate volume depletion in children. A Cochrane systematic review comparing oral rehydration therapy (ORT) with intravenous rehydration therapy (IVT) for acute gastroenteritis in children (< 18 years) found a treatment failure in 6.5% of patients in the ORT group as opposed to 2.9% in the IVT group, a statistically but not clinically significant difference.

• **Intravenous rehydration therapy** is recommended in the following settings:
  ○ if the child is unable to take ORT, e.g. due to excessive vomiting, alteration in mental status, ileus or damaged bowel
  ○ if the caretaker is unable to give ORT
  ○ in the presence of severe electrolyte problems.

**3. Choice of Fluid & Replacement Rate**
• **Volume over 24 hours** required to replenish normal body volume corresponds to:
  ○ fluid deficit, e.g. 100 ml/kg in a child with 10% volume depletion
  ○ daily fluid requirements: 100 ml/kg for the first 10 kg's + 50 ml/kg for the second 10 kg's + 20 ml/kg for subsequent kg's.

• **Intravenous rehydration therapy** need not be given as a bolus once shock has been managed with bolus therapy. A study of 3-11-year-old children with dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis showed no advantage with rapid (60 ml/kg over 1 hour) versus standard (20 ml/kg over 1 hour) rehydration.

• **Fluid composition** should be chosen to correct electrolyte abnormalities if present. Abnormal sodium concentrations should be changed no faster than 10 mmol/L/day. Repeated measurements of sodium levels are necessary to avoid rapid concentration changes and adjust therapy.

# Hemorrhagic Shock

## INTRODUCTION
- Critical bleeding is defined as a transfusion requirement > > 4 PRBC/hr or > 1 PRBC/10 kg body weight/hr
- The Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC) score assigns 1 point to each of the following: arrival SBP < 90 mm Hg, arrival heart rate > 120 bpm, penetrating mechanism and positive focused assessment with sonography for trauma for fluid. According to one study, a score of ≥ 2 predicted massive transfusion with SN 75-90% and SP 67-88%.
- The Revised Assessment of Bleeding and Transfusion (RABT) score assigns 1 point to each of the following: shock index (HR/SBT) > 1, pelvic fracture, penetrating injury, positive FAST: ≥ 2 points predicts massive transfusion SN 78% SP 91%.

## MASSIVE HEMORRHAGE PROTOCOL
Suggested indications for calling the blood bank and activating the MHP:
- Prior to patient arrival: severe mechanism of injury, anticoagulants or dual antiplatelet therapy, SBP < 100 mm Hg
- Initial assessment: RABT score ≥ 2
- Progression: moving into 3rd unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC).

## ULTRASOUND
- Intraperitoneal fluid suggests intraperitoneal hemorrhage, e.g. secondary to a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or a liver laceration (SN 83-88%, SP 95-100%). The average blood volume required to detect hemorrhage is 600 ml in the perihepatic window and 150 ml in the suprapubic window. Repeated examinations can help detect on-going bleeding.
- Intrathoracal fluid can be reliably identified and suggests hemothorax post-trauma.
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) > 5 cm can reliably be identified by US SN 99%, SP 98%. The presence of an AAA > 5 cm in a patient with shock suggests rupture.
- Retroperitoneal fluid cannot be reliably detected with US.

## MANAGEMENT
### 1. Mechanical Hemostatic Measures?

| Indications | Measures |
|-------------|-----------|
| Wound | • Pressure dressings applied to wounds<br>• Pack the wound, push in gauze<br>• Foley catheter into penetrating wounds, inflate cuff with 50 ml<br>• Tourniquet for extremity bleed not responding to pressure dressing |
| Pelvic ring fracture | • Pelvic closure using a bed sheet, pelvic binder, or pelvic C-clamp |
| Severe intrathoracic | • Acute thoracotomy |
| Severe pelvic or intraabdominal | • Proximal external aortic compression ("Knee-BOA")<br>• Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) |
| Vaginal bleeding | • Proximal external aortic compression ("Knee-BOA")<br>• Bimanual compression of the uterus<br>• Balloon tamponade of the uterus |
| Femur fracture | • Reduction and traction splint |

## 2. Initial Blood Tests
- pH, BE, HCO3-, lactate, Hb, electrolytes; thrombocytes, INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, blood type

## 3. Target Blood Pressure
- SBP 80-90 mm Hg (MAP ≥ 65 mm Hg, "hypotensive resuscitation/permissive hypotens.")
- SBP > 100 mm Hg (MAP ≥ 80 mm Hg) if traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury

## 4. Crystalloids?
- Crystalloids until pRBCs are available, yet ≥ 1.5 L associated with increased mortality
- Balanced electrolyte solutions (e.g. Ringer's acetate) as default crystalloid
- 0.9% NaCl in the setting of severe head trauma (hypotonic solutions are contraindicated)

## 5. Packed Red Blood Cells
- pRBCs are recommended early in the resuscitative process if suspected massive/critical bleeding. Target Hb 70-90 g/L. Administer 1-2 units of warm pRBCs via rapid infuser, 0 negative to fertile women, 0 positive to others.
- Activate MHP if > 2 pRBCs required.

## 6. Pharmacological Treatments?

| Treatments | Indications/Dose |
|------------|------------------|
| Tranexamic acid<br>(Cyklokapron®) | • Traumatic hemorrhagic shock within 3 hours of trauma<br>• Non-traumatic, non-gastrointestinal hemorrhagic shock<br>• 2 g IV over 10 min (30 mg/kg) |
| Fibrinogen<br>(Riastap®) | • Massive hemorrhage, activation of MHP<br>• 2 g (30 mg/kg) IV |
| Calcium | • Ca2+ < 1.15 mmol/L<br>• Calcium chloride 10% possibly better than Calcium gluconate 10%<br>• Administer 10 ml IV (0.3 ml/kg), recheck Ca2+ |

| Anticoags/platelets | Measures |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Warfarin | • PCC (Confidex® or Ocplex®) 2000 IE IV (80 ml)<br>• Vitamin K1 (Konakion®) 10 mg IV |
| Rivaroxaban (Xarelto®)<br>Apixaban (Eliquis®) | • Andexanet alfa: 400 mg within 15 min + 4 mg/min over 2 hours; or 800 mg within 30 min + 8 mg/min over hours<br>• PCC (Confidex® or Ocplex®) 2000 IE IV (80 ml) |
| Dabigatran (Pradaxa®) | • Idarucizumab 5 g IV over 5 min |
| Acetylsalicylic acid | • Desmopressin (Octostim®) 15 μg/ml 1 ml (50 kg) - 2 ml |
| Non-selective NSAID | (100 kg) (0.3 μg/kg) SC or in 10 ml saline IV over 10 min |
| Unfractionated Heparin<br>LMWH | • Protamine sulfate to reverse a high or recent dose of unfractionated Heparin (50 mg protaminsulfate neutralizes 7000 IE heparin) and critical bleeding < 4 hrs since LMWH |
| Situations | Treatments |
|------------|------------|
| • Upper<br>gastrointestinal<br>hemorrhage | • Esomeprazol (Nexium®) 80 mg IV<br>• Terlipressin 2 mg IV and Cefotaxime 1 g IV if known liver<br>cirrhosis (possible bleeding esophageal varices) |

**7. Tubes?**
• Foley catheter may be inserted to follow hourly diuresis
• Chest tube for suspected hemothorax, > 1 L blood loss directly or > 200 ml/hr blood loss after initial blood evacuation suggests need for surgery
• Nasogastric tube may confirm upper GI-bleed but the sensitivity is poor
• Endotracheal intubation to secure the airway. RSI may lead to hypotension

**8. Additional Measures?**
• Hypothermia (core temperature < 35°C) should be prevented and if present corrected
• Antibiotics, e.g. Cloxacillin (Ekvacillin®) 2 g IV (≤ 20 kg: 50 mg/kg) for open extremity fractures
• Tetanus prophylaxis for open wounds (diTeBooster® 0.5 ml IM)

**9. Further Management**
• Massive Hemorrhage Protocol: administer thrombocytes when available (not through rapid infuser). Administer FFP, target 2:1:1 pRCB:FFP:Thrombocytes over coming hours.
• Laparotomy/thoracotomy for on-going intraabdominal/intrathoracic hemorrhage
• Angiography and embolization/EVAR for pelvic bleeding/ruptured AAA
• Endoscopy for patients with significant upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding
• CT if unknown bleeding source AND patient stabilized after initial resuscitation

# Pulmonary Embolism

## INTRODUCTION
High-risk pulmonary emboli (PE) are those that result in right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and failure due to pressure overload and an increased risk of PE-related in-hospital or 30-day mortality. A high-risk PE is one that results in one of the following:
* shock (cardiogenic)
* hypotension (SBP < 90 mm Hg or drop in SBP > 40 mm Hg) lasting for > 15 min and not caused by new-onset arrhythmia, hypovolemia, or sepsis
* pulselessness
* persistent profound bradycardia (heart rate < 40 bpm with signs or symptoms of shock)

## BEDSIDE TESTS

| Test | Findings |
|------|-----------|
| BBT | • Increased (Pa-EtCO₂ gradient: mean of 5 kPa (37 mm Hg) among three patients with massive PE versus 0.3 kPa (0.2 mm Hg) among nine patients with shock due to another cause in one small case series.<br>• Hypocapnia may be present |
| EKG | • Negative T waves in the precordial (V1-V4) and lead III suggest RV overload<br>• The EKG may evolve from a narrow-complex tachycardia to an incomplete and then complete **right bundle branch**, suggesting life-threatening pulmonary hypertension and impending cardiac arrest |
| US | One study reported SN 100% for central PE if ≥ 1 of the following present:<br>• A4C: dilated RV (RV:LV ≥ 1 at the atrio-ventricular valve level)<br>• A4C: TAPSE < 17 mm (normal TAPSE is 16-20 mm)<br>• A4C: McConnell's sign (hypokinesia RV free wall, preserved apical function)<br>• PSAX: D-sign<br>• Evidence of DVT on 3-point ultrasound<br>The same study reported that all but one patient with central PE had ≥ 2 of the heart ultrasound findings above. |

## MANAGEMENT
### 1. Cardiac Arrest?
* **Indication**: unconscious and no effective breathing
* Cardiopulmonary resuscitation
* Adrenalin 1 mg IV bolus
* rt-PA 50 mg IV bolus; repeat if no improvement after 15 min
* Call ECMO team
* Heparin 5000 units IV bolus

### 2. Oxygen?
* **Indication**: SpO2 < 95%. Oxygen is a pulmonary vasodilator.
* Oxygen mask with reservoir
* High-Flow Nasal Intubation can be used to avoid endotracheal intubation

### 3. Adrenalin?
* **Indication**: SBP < 85 mm Hg, bradycardia (which may signal impending cardiac arrest)

Here's the markdown transcription of the medical document:

• Hypotension is part of the death spiral of the RV, hence pressors should be started early, Adrenalin as the first line pressor.

**4. Thrombolysis?**
• Indication: SBP < 85 mm Hg or bradycardia (which may signal impending cardiac arrest)
• "Absolute" contraindications:
  ○ Hemorrhagic stroke
  ○ Ischemic stroke within 3 months
  ○ Brain- or spinal surgery within 3 weeks
  ○ Active serious bleeding
  ○ Vascular malformation f ex AVM
• rt-PA 20 mg IV bolus. Complete treatment with additional rt-PA 50-80 mg IV over 90 min

**5. Inhaled Pulmonary Vasodilator?**
• Indication: for massive PE or high-risk submassive PE to stabilize the patient as a bridge to other therapy (systemic thrombolysis or mechanical clot extraction).
• Epoprostenol or nitric oxide or both
• Nitroglycerin 5 mg nebulized over 15 min if neither are available; repeat after 30 min
• Patients with massive PE die of cardiovascular collapse due to acute pulmonary hypertension, and not from hypoxemia. The hemodynamic deterioration is due to pulmonary vasoconstrictors released in the response to the clot, and not due to the clot itself. Pulmonary vasodilators improve cardiac output without increasing the workload for the RV.

**6. Endotracheal Intubation?**
• Indications: cardiac arrest, severe hypoxemia not responding to other measures
• Risks: can lead to cardiac arrest through decreased preload (positive pressure ventilation), sedatives (vasodilation), increased pulmonary vascular resistance (positive pressure ventilation). Should ideally be avoided or delayed.
• Esketamine (0.25 mg/kg) or etomidate are preferable to induction agents that depress cardiac function or reduce preload if endotracheal intubation is required because of impending respiratory failure.
• Low tidal volumes (approximately 6 mL/kg lean body weight) are recommended to keep the end-inspiratory plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O.

**7. Unfractionated Heparin**
• Indication: high-risk PE
• Contraindication: received rt-PA
• Unfractionated heparin 80 U/kg IV bolus (or 5,000 U) followed by an infusion of 18 U/kg/hr.

**8. Diagnostic Confirmation?**
• Indication: diagnostic confirmation with CT is recommended for the stabilized patient.
• Contraindication: patient too unstable to leave the ED and immediate CT angiography may not be available. Under these circumstances, unequivocal signs of RV pressure overload and dysfunction in a haemodynamically compromised patient justify emergency thrombolysis without further testing.

**9. Surgical Embolectomy, Catheter-Delivered Therapy & ECMO**
• Indications: rt-PA absolutely contraindicated or failed to respond to rt-PA

# Tension Pneumothorax

## INTRODUCTION
A tension pneumothorax is a condition where the intrapleural pressure exceeds the atmospheric pressure, thereby impairing cardiac preload and ventilation. A tension pneumothorax develops when a one-way, "ball-valve" or "flap-valve" mechanism results in more air entering the pleural space on inspiration than leaving the pleural space on expiration.

## CONTEXT
| Risk<br>factors | • Penetrating or blunt trauma<br>• Procedures e.g. central venous catheterization<br>• Cardiopulmonary resuscitation<br>• Severe asthma or COPD patient receiving positive pressure ventilation<br>• Majority of patients are undergoing positive pressure ventilation |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Presenting<br>problems | • Severe dyspnea<br>• Feeling of impending doom<br>• Syncope<br>• Chest trauma |

## ABCDE
| A | • Distended neck/forehead veins may be present, even if the patient is hypotensive<br>• Tracheal deviation away from the side of the pneumothorax is a late finding |
|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| B | • Low SpO₂<br>• Tachypnea<br>• Difficulty ventilating the patient because of increased airway pressure may be an early sign of tension pneumothorax in an intubated patient<br>• Diminished breath sounds on the injured side<br>• Hyperresonant to percussion<br>• Asymmetrical chest expansion<br>• Subcutaneous emphysema may be present |
| C | • Hypotension<br>• Pulsus paradoxus (> 12 mm Hg decrease in SBP upon inspiration) may be present<br>• Tachycardia |
| D | • Restlessness, agitation |
| E | • Profuse diaphoresis may be present. |

## BEDSIDE TESTS
| BBT | • Hypoxia<br>• CO₂ retention can also occur |
|-----|------------------------------------------|
| US  | • Lung sliding is absent with pneumothorax |

## MANAGEMENT
**1. Needle Decompression**
• Needle insertion in the 4th or 5th intercostal space in the anterior axillary line
• Converts a tension pneumothorax to a normal pressure pneumothorax

**2. Chest Tube**
• Placement of a chest tube prevent the reaccumulation of pressure in the pleural space

# Pericardial Tamponade

## INTRODUCTION
Pericardial tamponade occurs when the pressure of fluid trapped between the pericardium and the myocardium equalizes the right ventricular diastolic pressure and subsequently the left ventricular diastolic pressure, leading to impaired preload. Cardiac output may initially be maintained through an increase in heart rate and contractility. The pericardial sac is distensible, and large amounts of fluid can accumulate gradually without hemodynamic compromise, whereas the rapid accumulation of small amounts of fluid may overwhelm the distensibility of the pericardium and lead to tamponade.

## Differential Diagnosis of Pericardial Tamponade
| Pathophysiology | Examples |
|-----------------|-----------|
| "Surgical" tamponade:<br>sudden onset of<br>hemodynamic compromise | • Aortic dissection<br>• Free-wall rupture (occuring days after a myocardial infarction)<br>• Penetrating chest trauma |
| "Medical" tamponade:<br>absence of dramatic onset | • Acute idiopathic pericarditis<br>• Malignancy<br>• Acute myocardial infarction<br>• End-stage renal disease<br>• Congestive heart failure<br>• Collagen-vascular disease (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus)<br>• Bacterial infections, tuberculosis |

## CONTEXT
| Risk factors | • Trauma, especially penetrating thoracic trauma.<br>• Breast/lung cancer: pericardial tamponade occurs due to pericardial seeding. |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Presenting problems | • Dyspnea (87-89% of cases)<br>• Presyncope or syncope, decreased level of consciousness.<br>• Acute chest pain e.g. secondary to aortic dissection |

## ABCDE
| A | • Distended neck veins SN 76%. Distended neck veins are, along with hypotension and muffled heart sounds, part of Beck's triad. |
|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| B | • Tachypnea SN 80% |
| C | • Hypotension SN 26%, part of the classic Beck's triad.<br>• Hypertension SN 33% may occur in some patients with "medical" tamponade.<br>• Tachycardia SN 77%<br>• Pulsus paradoxus, a SBP drop > 10 mm Hg upon inspiration: SN 82%; LR+ 3.3; LR- 0.03. |
| E | • Fever in the context of a pericardial effusion suggests an infectious etiology or immune-mediated connective tissue disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus<br>• Ewart's sign refers to dullness to percussion under the left scapula resulting from the accumulation of large amounts of pericardial fluid. |

# BEDSIDE TESTS

| EKG | • Low QRS voltage SN 42% (32-53)<br>• Electrical alternans refers to changes in the amplitude and/or morphology of the EKG waves due to oscillation of the heart within the pericardial sac.<br>• ST segment elevation and PR depression may be present in the context of pericardial inflammation. |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| US  | • Pericardial fluid and a hyperdynamic heart<br>• Right atrial collapse during systole<br>• Right ventricular collapse (or "scalloping") during diastole<br>• Dilated IVC without inspiratory collapse in the absence of concomitant hypovolemia<br>• Exaggeration of respirophasic changes in flow velocities across the tricuspid and mitral valves |

# MANAGEMENT
**1. Fluid?**
• **Indication**: fluid therapy (e.g. Ringer's acetate 500 ml IV bolus (10 ml/kg)) is only of value if the patient is concomitantly hypovolemic.

**2. Pericardiocentesis?**
• **Indications** for pericardiocentesis, ideally utrasound-guided:
  ○ "Medical" tamponade where pericardial fluid has gradually developed
  ○ Traumatic cardiac arrest if thoracotomy is not possible
  ○ "Surgical" tamponade as a bridge to thoracotomy. However, in this setting, pericardiocentesis will likely provide only temporary improvement since on-going bleeding will cause a rapid reaccumulation of blood in the pericardium

**3. Acute thoracotomy?**
• **Indication**: acute thoracotomy is indicated for "surgical" tamponade, i.e. when cardiac tamponade occurs following trauma, aortic dissection or free-wall rupture

# Cardiogenic Shock

## INTRODUCTION
Cardiogenic shock is defined as a state of prolonged hypotension (SBP usually < 90 mm Hg) in the absence of hypovolemia, associated with signs of hypoperfusion (cold extremities, clammy skin, confusion, oliguria, elevated lactate). Cardiogenic shock may result from several causes. The most common cause (80%) is acute coronary syndrome with or without structural problems. Structural problems (e.g. papillary muscle rupture) account for 12% of cases of cardiogenic shock associated with myocardial infarction.

## Differential Diagnosis of Cardiogenic Shock

| Pathophysiology | Examples |
|----------------|-----------|
| Decreased contractility | • Acute myocardial ischemia affecting the left ventricle (LV) or right ventricle (RV)<br>• Fulminant myocarditis, cardiomyopathy (e.g. Takotsubo), myocardial contusion<br>• Hypoxia, sepsis, hypocalcemia |
| Structural problems | • Papillary muscle rupture with resulting acute mitral regurgitation<br>• Free-wall rupture resulting in pericardial tamponade<br>• Infective endocarditis<br>• Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy |
| Arrhythmias | • Tachyarrhythmias<br>• Bradyarrhythmias<br>• Hyperkalemia |
| Poisoning | • Beta-blockers<br>• Calcium antagonists<br>• Sodium channel blockers |

## CONTEXT
• Recent myocardial infarction suggests structural problems (occurs within days; free wall rupture usually occurs within 24 hours of myocardial infarction) or stent thrombosis.
• Patients present with chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, impaired mentation

## ABCDE
| | |
|-|-|
| A | • Jugular venous pressure (JVP) is elevated in the setting of right ventricular failure. |
| B | • Crackles suggest pulmonary edema due to volume overload |
| C | • Hypotension (< 90 mm Hg) and narrow pulse pressure are signs of poor perfusion.<br>• Bradycardia may be present in the setting of right coronary artery ischemia.<br>• Third heart sound (S3) is a relatively specific finding of heart failure in adults.<br>• New systolic murmur suggests mitral insufficiency resulting from a papillary muscle rupture or a ventricular septal defect. |
| D | • Impaired mentation may be present due to poor perfusion |
| E | • Cold extremities are a sign of poor perfusion<br>• Lower extremity edema is consistent with volume overload, but it may also occur with venous incompetence. It is neither sensitive nor specific for cardiogenic shock. |

# BEDSIDE TESTS

| Test | Findings |
|------|-----------|
| EKG | • ST elevation, ST depression and/or T wave inversions may be present in the setting of myocardial ischemia, myocarditis and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy<br>• Wide QRS complexes suggest ischemia-induced bundle branch block, poisoning with membrane stabilising agents, ventricular arrhythmias, or hyperK<br>• Consider supplementing 12-lead EKG with right sided and posterior leads |
| US | • Poor contractility may be present in the setting of acute ischemia<br>• Pericardial fluid and tamponade suggest free wall rupture<br>• Mechanical problems e.g. mitral regurgitation, VSD, may be revealed with doppler<br>• B-lines on lung ultrasound may be present in the setting of pulmonary edema |

# MANAGEMENT

**1. Oxygen**
• Supplemental oxygen should be given to maintain SpO₂ > 90%

**2. IV Crystalloids?**
• **Indication:** in RV failure, cautious IV fluid therapy may improve blood pressure.
• **Risks:** in LV failure, IV fluids may worsen pulmonary edema without improving cardiac output. In RV failure, excessive fluid therapy may lead to hemodynamic worsening.

**3. Cause-Targeted Treatments?**
• **STEMI:** consider ASA, Heparin and PCI (see STEMI).
• **Structural problems:** consider urgent thoracic surgery
• **Tachyarrhythmia:** consider acute cardioversion (see Tachycardia)
• **Bradycardia:** consider atropine, isoprenalin and transcutaneous cardiac pacing.
• **Hyperkalemia:** consider calcium, insulin + glucose, beta-2 agonist (see Hyperkalemia)
• **Calcium Channel/Beta Blocker OD:** see Calcium Channel/Beta Blocker Toxidrome
• **Intoxication:** intravenous fat emulsion (Intralipid® 20% 100 ml (1.5 ml/kg) IV over 1-2 minutes may be useful in the management of cardiovascular collapse caused by lipid-soluble drugs. Lipophilic drugs toxic to the myocardium include tricyclic antidepressants, Verapamil, Cardizem, Propranolol, Atenolol, Metoprolol, Carbamazepin.

**4. Vasopressors & inotropes**
• **Indication:** SBP < 85 mm Hg and/or hypoperfusion
• **Noradrenalin** 1 mg/ml 2 ml in 48 ml saline = 40 μg/ml. Initial infusion rate 0.1 μg/kg/min. Target MAP ≥ 65 mm Hg
• **Dobutamine** 12.5 mg/ml 8 ml in 42 ml saline = 2 mg/ml. Infusion 2.5 - 20 μg/kg/min if poor cardiac function after MAP corrected

**5. Vasodilators**
• **Nitroprusside** (start dose 0.5 mg/kg/min) can reduce RV and LV afterload, resulting in improved stroke volume and, in certain cases, a paradoxical increase in blood pressure.

**6. Mechanical Circulatory Support**
• **Intraaortic Balloon Pump** (IABP), **ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation** (ECMO) or **LV Assist Devices** (LVAD) may be used as "bridge to recovery" until surgical measures or recovery of myocardial contractility (e.g. in the setting of mechanical problems, severe myocarditis, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or poisoning with a calcium channel blocker).

# Septic Shock

## INTRODUCTION
Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The clinical criteria for sepsis are the presence of both:
* Suspected or documented infection
* Acute increase in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 2 points.

The qSOFA (quick SOFA) score identifies patients with suspected infection who have an increased risk of mortality or prolonged ICU admission, i.e. those with ≥ 2 of the following:
* Respiratory rate ≥ 22/min
* Systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mm Hg
* Altered mentation

Septic shock is a subset of sepsis associated with substantially increased mortality due to profound circulatory and cellular/metabolic abnormalities. The clinical criteria for severe sepsis (associated with a hospital mortality > 40%) are the presence, despite adequate volume resuscitation, of both:
* Persisting hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mm Hg
* Serum lactate level > 2 mmol/L

## MANAGEMENT
### 1. Oxygen?
In the absence of underlying lung disease and risk of CO₂ retention:
* SpO₂ ≤ 90%: Oxygen 10 L/min via mask with reservoir
* SpO₂ 91-95%: Oxygen 3 L/min via nasal prongs.

### 2. Crystalloid Infusion
* Crystalloid 500-1000 ml within 30 min for patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion with suspicion of hypovolemia.
* Ultrasound to measure IVC diameter during inspiration and expiration may provide a measure of fluid responsiveness, whereby fluid should be administered as long as the IVC collapses upon inspiration.

### 3. Push Dose Pressor?
* **Indication**: SBP < 60 mm Hg (i.e. bridge to effect of fluid therapy or acute vasopressor therapy). Two alternatives:
* Adrenalin 0.1 mg/ml 1 ml in a 10 ml syringe. Dilute with 9 ml NaCl. Administer 2 ml (20 μg) IV push. Repeat after 3 min as needed. Alpha and beta (inotrope, chronotrope) effects.
* Phenylephrine 10 mg/ml 1 ml, inject into 100 ml saline (yields a 0.1 mg/ml solution). Give 1 ml (100 μg) IV every 3 min. Alpha effect (vasopressor), no beta effect.

### 4. Vasopressor?
* **Indication**: when fluids are insufficient to maintain MAP > 65 mm Hg. Consider if initial SBP < 70 mm Hg, reassess need for vasopressor therapy after fluid administration.
* Noradrenalin 1 mg/ml 4 ml added to 1 L normal saline or 5% glucose (4 μg/ml solution). Start dose of 0.05 μg/kg/min for a 70 kg patient corresponds to an infusion rate of 50 ml/hr.

Here's the markdown transcription of the medical document:

**5. Cultures**
- Blood cultures x 2 sites (aerobic and anaerobic) prior to antibiotic administration if such cultures do not cause significant delay (> 45 min) in the start of antimicrobial therapy
- Urine culture + urine dipstick
- Specific cultures e.g. through vascular access devices, nasal-pharyngeal swab, wound cultures (rapid antigen Group A Strep)

**6. Bladder Catheterization?**
- **Indication:** low blood pressure or elevated lactate; in order to follow urinary output and acquire urine for culture

**7. Blood Tests?**
- Thrombocytes
- INR: elevated levels suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
- Blood tests: abnormal levels suggest cholangitis/cholecystitis/pancreatitis
- CK: elevated levels suggest rhabdomyolysis

**8. Antibiotics**
- Time to appropriate antibiotic therapy **most important prognostic factor** in severe sepsis
- Choice of antibiotic should take into consideration presumed infection source, infection severity, local resistance patterns, host factors such as allergies, immunosuppression.
- Local on-line antibiotic guide: ___________________________________

**9. Corticosteroids?**
- **Indication:** patients with known **adrenal insufficiency** or taking **chronic steroid treatment**; otherwise, corticosteroids are **not routinely** recommended in sepsis.
- Hydrocortisone (Solu-Cortef®) 100 mg IV and then a doubling of the daily dose if the temperature is > 38°C or a tripling of the daily dose if the temperature is > 39°C.

**10. Source Control**
- A specific anatomic site of infection requiring consideration for emergent source control (e.g. necrotizing soft tissue infection, intra-abdominal abscess, GI perforation, cholangitis, intestinal infarction, infected device, infected tampon, empyema, septic arthritis) should be identified, and the required intervention (e.g. abscess drainage, surgical debridement) undertaken for source control within the first 12 hrs.
- Detection modalities include a careful physical examination (including inspecting the perineum); ultrasound to detect e.g. abscess, hydronephrosis, pleural fluid, cholecystitis; bedside chest-x-ray; LP if meningoencephalitis is suspected; CT thorax/abdomen.

**11. Blood Transfusion**
- **Indication:** Hb < 70 g/L

**12. Criteria for ICU Admission**
- SpO₂ < 90 % despite O₂ 15L/min via mask with reservoir
- Respiratory rate > 30/min despite 15 L/min O₂ via mask with reservoir
- SBP < 90 mm Hg despite 1000 ml crystalloid over 30 minutes
- Elevated or rising serum lactate
- Diuresis < 0.5 ml/kg/h after 6 hours

# Adrenal Crisis

## INTRODUCTION
- Primary adrenal insufficiency results from pathology of the adrenal cortex as a whole. Aldosterone and cortisol secretion are usually both affected.
- Secondary adrenal insufficiency refers to hypocortisolemia resulting from pituitary or hypothalamic pathology. Mineralocorticoid function is preserved in secondary adrenal insufficiency.
- Relative adrenal insufficiency refers to relative hypocortisolemia during acute stress in the setting of acute critical illness, such as severe sepsis and trauma.
- Chronic adrenal insufficiency manifests itself as fatigue, weakness, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, joint pain, myalgias, dizziness, hyperpigmentation of non-sunlight-exposed skin areas (in primary insufficiency), low sodium, high potassium, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia. Chronic primary adrenal insufficiency is also known as Addison's disease.
- Acute adrenal insufficiency, also known as adrenal crisis, occurs in the setting of acute adrenal, pituitary or hypothalamic pathology, or more commonly in the setting of chronic adrenal insufficiency exposed to exogenous stress such as infection or trauma. Shock due to mineralocorticoid deficiency dominates the clinical presentation.

## CONTEXT
| Patient | • Risk factors (vascular, infections, neoplastic, auto-immune, exogenous<br>corticosteroids > 4 weeks) for either acute or chronic adrenal insufficiency |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Problem | • Patients may present with acute abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, fever.<br>• Patients with acute pituitary pathology may present with headache, visual<br>field defects, delirium, seizures. |

## BEDSIDE TESTS
| BBT | • Metabolic acidosis due to shock<br>• Hyponatremia is present in 90% of cases of primary adrenal insufficiency.<br>Hyponatremia can be present in cases of secondary adrenal insufficiency due to<br>the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.<br>• Hyperkalemia is present in 65% of cases of primary adrenal insufficiency due<br>to aldosterone deficiency but not in cases of secondary adrenal deficiency.<br>• Hypoglycemia may occur with primary adrenal insufficiency<br>• Hypercalcemia can rarely occur due to increased intestinal calcium absorption<br>and decreased renal excretion. Hypercalcemia mainly occurs in the context of<br>concurrent hyperthyroidism<br>• Increased creatinine can result from prerenal failure due to mineralocorticoid<br>deficiency in cases of primary adrenal insufficiency |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EKG | • QTc prolongation may occur |
| US  | • Small IVC with collapse upon inspiration |

## MANAGEMENT
1. **Ringer's Acetate**
- Ringer's acetate 1000 ml bolus IV; physiologic normal saline 1 L/h. Large volumes may be required.

Here's the markdown transcription of the medical document:

**2. Glucose**
- Indication: hypoglycemia
- Glucose 300 mg/ml 30 ml then glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) 1000 ml infusion

**3. Blood Tests**
- **Plasma cortisol and ACTH:** The diagnosis of chronic adrenal insufficiency is based on morning cortisol levels. In a state of stress, however, cortisol levels should be elevated (> 20 ug/dL). In the acute setting, critically ill patients with suspected adrenal insufficiency, blood should be sent for cortisol and ACTH measurement followed by immediate hydrocortisone therapy.
- **Plasma renin and aldosterone** may also be measured. Renin and aldosterone concentrations will be elevated if the adrenal glands are unable to produce mineralocorticoids.
- **TSH and T4** may also be measured, due to the possibility of concomittant autoimmune thyroid disease or multiple endocrine abnormalities.

**4. Corticosteroids**
- **Hydrocortisone (Solu-Cortef®)** 100 mg IV (2 mg/kg) is the steroid used most commonly. In addition to glucocorticoid effects, high dose hydrocortisone has a mineralocorticoid effect that precludes the concomitant administration of a mineralocorticoid.
- **Dexamethasone** 6 mg IV does not interfere with serum cortisol assays which may be advantageous for patients without a previous diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. It has no mineralocorticoid effect but adequate sodium replacement can be achieved by intravenous saline alone.
- Hydrocortisone (or other steroids with glucocorticoid activity) should be continued until confirmatory results are available. Options include:
  - Hydrocortisone 50 – 100 mg every 6 h
  - Hydrocortisone 100-200 mg infusion over 24 hours

**5. Antibiotics?**
- When an infection is the suspected trigger of acute adrenal crisis, patients should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics and "source control" (see Sepsis)

**6. Vasopressors?**
- Vasopressor therapy is indicated in the setting of persisting hypotension despite fluid resuscitation. However, cortisol deficiency may account for relative unresponsiveness to catecholamines.

**7. ICU**
- ICU admission is indicated for patients who requires invasive monitoring and/or vasopressor support

**8. Short ACTH stimulation test**
- A short ACTH stimulation test can be carried out to determine the cause of the adrenal insufficiency in patients without a previous diagnosis

# Neurogenic Shock

## INTRODUCTION
- Neurogenic shock is caused by peripheral sympathetic denervation resulting from bilateral disruption of the descending sympathetic pathways in the cervical cord and the upper thoracic level (T1-T4). Hypotension results from loss of arteriolar tone due to sympathetic hypoactivity and unopposed parasympathetic outflow through the vagal nerve

- Spinal shock, often confused with neurogenic shock, refers to a temporary flaccid paralysis as well as loss of sensation and reflexes below the level of spinal cord injury. Bowel and bladder reflexes are lost. Circulation is not affected as it is in neurogenic shock. Spinal shock lasts from hours to days. The degree of recovery depends on the extent of the initial insult. Even with severe injury, patients recover spinal cord reflexes such as the bulbocavernous and anal wink.

## CONTEXT
- Neurogenic shock should be suspected in the setting of shock following trauma to the head and neck.

## ABCDE
| | |
|---|---|
|B|• Paradoxical chest movements result from loss of innervation of the intercostal muscles while the diaphragmatic innervation from the phrenic nerve (C3-C4-C5) is intact.|
|C|• Hypotension results from loss of arteriolar tone leading to venous pooling.<br>• Bradycardia results from interruption of cardiac sympathetics (T1-T4) and unopposed vagal activity.|
|D|• Horner's syndrome is present if the level is above T1.<br>• Bilateral paralysis of the lower extremities; the extent of arm weakness depends on the level of the lesion.<br>• Sensory level depending on the site of the lesion (note: the sensory level is assessment by moving down the side of the neck, progressing down the outside of the arm and up the inside of the arm towards the axilla; the last normal level is the patient's neurological level.|
|E|• Loss of sympathetic activation leads to warm, dry skin due to cutaneous vasodilation.<br>• Priapism may be present due to unopposed parasympathetic tone.<br>• Hypothermia occurs due to lack of peripheral vasoconstriction and heat loss as well as altered thermoregulation.|

## BEDSIDE TESTS

# MANAGEMENT

1. **Target Mean Arterial Pressure**
- MAP should be kept > 90 mm Hg to ensure optimal spinal cord perfusion.

2. **Crystalloids?**
- Initial shock management consists of crystalloid infusion. However, overzealous fluid resuscitation may lead to pulmonary edema, impaired ventilation and cord edema which may impair tissue perfusion.

3. **Atropine?**
- Indication: bradycardia
- Atropine 0.5 mg IV should be given prior to procedures that stimulate the vagus (e.g. oropharyngeal suctioning, endotracheal intubation) since these procedures may lead to profound bradycardia.

4. **Prevention of hypothermia?**
- Indication: patients with neurogenic shock may easily become hypothermic

5. **Vasopressors?**
- Indication: a vasopressor should be added if necessary to maintain MAP > 85 mm Hg
- Noradrenalin, Adrenalin: agents with both α- and β-agonist properties such as norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine are preferred given their chronotropic activity

6. **Bladder Catheterization**
- Indication: the bladder should be catheterized due to the risk of urinary retention and to follow urinary output.

7. **Pacemaker?**
- Indication: refractory bradycardia

8. **Admission**
- Patients with severe neurogenic shock should be admitted to the neuroICU for monitoring of CVP. Contact the neurosurgeon.

9. **MR**
- MR is the modality of choice to investigate suspected spinal cord pathology

**Therapies of Unproven Benefit**
- Corticosteroids for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury are **not recommended**.

# Hypertensive Emergencies & Aortic Dissection

## INTRODUCTION
- Significantly Elevated Blood Pressure (previously called "Hypertensive Crisis") is defined as SBP > 180 mm Hg and/or DBP > 120 mm Hg
- Hypertensive Emergency is defined as Significantly Elevated Blood Pressure *with* signs or symptoms of acute, on-going end-organ damage. The organs in question are brain, heart, lung, aorta, kidney.
- Asymptomatic Significantly Elevated Blood Pressure (previously called "Hypertensive Urgency") is defined as Significantly Elevated Blood Pressure *without* signs or symptoms of acute, on-going end-organ damage.
- Aortic Dissection occurs when the aortic intima tears and a column of blood gains access to the media. In 65% of cases, the tear occurs within 3 cm of the coronary ostia. Two other conditions--intramural aortic hematoma and penetrating aortic ulcer--share similar features with aortic dissection and together these conditions are referred to as **acute aortic syndromes**. Decreasing SBP, HR and inotropy reduces the dissection progression and mortality.

## BACKGROUND

# MANAGEMENT
## General Principles
- In asymptomatic significantly elevated BP, blood pressure should be gradually reduced over hours to days.
- In cases of hypertensive emergencies, the mean arterial pressure should be reduced by 10-20% within the first 1 hour (usually < 180/120 mm Hg). Further mean arterial pressure reduction by 5-15% within the next 23 hours (usually < 160/110 mm Hg).
- Exceptions: Aortic Dissection and Neurological Emergency

### 1. Hypertensive Myocardial Ischemia
- IV vasodilator (e.g. Nitroglycerin)
- If insufficient effect, add IV beta-blockers (Labetalol, Esmolol, Metoprolol)

### 2. Hypertensive Pulmonary Edema
- IV vasodilator (Nitroglycerin, Nitroprusside).
- Add loop diuretics (Furosemide) if volume overloaded (e.g. associated renal failure)
- See Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema

### 3. Aortic Dissection
- Goal is to reduce SBP to 100 – 120 mm Hg and HR < 60 bpm within 20 min of diagnosis
- Treat pain with IV opioids, e.g. Fentanyl 50 μg/ml 1 μg/kg IV
- Labetalol 5 mg/ml (Trandate®) 20 mg IV initially then 20-80 mg q10 min
- If HR < 60 bpm and SBP > 120 mm Hg: Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL every 60 seconds
- If HR > 60 bpm and SBP < 120 mm Hg: Metoprolol 5 mg IV

### 4. Hypertensive Emergency During Pregnancy
- Treat if SBP > 160 mm Hg or DBP > 110 mm Hg. Labetalol IV, target SBT 140-160 mm Hg and DBP 90-110 mm Hg, max MAP reduction 25% over the first two hours.
- Magnesium sulfate 5 g (Addex®-Magnesium 1 mmol/ml 20 ml) IV over 5 min loading dose

### 5. Sympathomimetic Crisis / Cocaine-Amphetamine Toxicity
- If agitated: benzodiazepines IV (e.g. Diazepam 5 mg IV, repeat as needed)
- Nitroprusside or phenolamine IV. Use medications with beta-blocking effect controversial, but there is currently no good evidence that Labetalol is dangerous.

### 6. Hypertensive Neurological Emergencies
- Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage: target SBP < 140 - 180 mm Hg
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage: target SBP < 140 - 160 mm Hg, allow higher if decreased LOC
- Stroke, tPA candidate: target SBP < 185 mm Hg and DBP < 110 mm Hg pre tPA
- Stroke, not tPA candidate: reduce BP by 15% over 24 hr if SBP > 220 or DBP > 120

| Medication | Type | Dosage |
|------------|------|---------|
| Nitroprusside | Infusion | 0.3 μg/kg/min, increase up to 10 μg/kg/min |
| Labetalol | Bolus<br>Infusion | 20 mg IV initially then 20-80 mg q10 min to total dose 300 mg<br>0.5 to 2 mg/min |
| Esmolol | Bolus<br>Infusion | 0.5 mg/kg over 1 min<br>50 μg/kg/min, titrate up to 300 μg/kg/min |
| Nitroglycerin | Bolus<br>Infusion | 0.4 mg SL every 60 seconds; or 2 mg bolus IV q3min<br>10-20 μg/min, titrate rapidly up to 200 μg/min |

# Bacterial Meningitis & Herpes Encephalitis

## EPIDEMIOLOGY
- Bacterial meningitis can be community acquired, health-care associated (neurosurgery, ventricular drains or shunts) or post cranial trauma (e.g. basilar skull fracture)
- Herpes encephalitis follows an episode of primary HSV-1 infection (one third of cases) or recurrent HSV-1 infection (one third of cases)

# Hyponatremic Encephalopathy

## INTRODUCTION
Hyponatremic encephalopathy is a condition characterized by neurological symptoms (headache, lethargy, obtundation, seizures, coma, respiratory arrest) brought on by cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure resulting from a rapid decrease in serum sodium. Severe symptoms usuall occur once the serum Na is < 120 mmol/L.

## ABCDE
| | |
|---|---|
| B | • Respiratory arrest may occur in severe cases<br>• Neurogenic pulmonary edema may also occur |
| C | • Cardiac arrhythmias may occur |
| D | • Confusion, somnolence, coma may occur<br>• Seizures may occur<br>• Decorticate posturing may occur<br>• Anisocoria and dilated pupils may occur |

## MANAGEMENT
### 1. Hypertonic Saline
• Prepare Hypertonic Saline by adding 20 ml of NaCl concentrate 4 mmol/ml (i.e. 80 mmol) to 250 ml of normal saline (NaCl 0.9%). This yields 270 ml of NaCl 2.6% solution.<br>
• Administer 270 ml IV of NaCl 2.6% over 15 minutes (4 ml/kg for children).<br>
• Remeasure Na and infuse more hypertonic NaCl if needed to raise [Na] by 5 mmol/L.

### 2. Sodium Bicarbonate?
• An alternative to NaCl 3% is NaHCO3. The corresponding volume of NaHCO3 will depend on the concentration of the NaHCO3 solution:<br>
  ○ 100 ml of a 5% concentration (50 mg/ml) contains 60 mmol of Na, corresponding to 117 ml of NaCl 3%. A conservative approach is to infuse 200 ml and remeasure [Na].<br>
  ○ 50 ml of an 8.4% concentration contains 50 mmol of Na, corresponding to 100 ml of NaCl 3%. Infusing 150 ml of this solution corresponds to infusing 300 ml of 3% NaCl.

### 3. Blood and Urine Tests
• Bladder catheterization allows for following diuresis and obtaining urine<br>
• Urine sodium concentration (U-Na) & Urine osmolarity (U-osm)<br>
• Serum osmolarity (S-osm) +/- TSH, T4, Cortisol

### 4. Admission & Monitoring
• Patients with hyponatremic encephalopathy should be admitted to a ward where close biochemical and clinical monitoring can be provided.<br>
• Follow urine output, remeasure plasma sodium hourly initially.<br>
• The serum Na should be increased by no more than 8 mmol/L during every 24 hrs until the Na reaches 130 mmol/L. See Hyponatremia.

# Increased Intracranial Pressure

## INTRODUCTION
- Normal intracranial pressure (ICP) is 5-15 mm Hg (7.5 - 20 cm H₂O) in adults and older children, 3-7 mm Hg in younger children and 1.5-6 mm Hg for term infants.
- Pathologic intracranial hypertension in adults is present with pressures ≥ 20 mm Hg. Sustained values > 40 mm Hg indicate severe, life-threatening intracranial hypertension.
- Cerebral herniation occurs when increases in intracranial volume overwhelm the compensatory capacities of the central nervous system

## DISABILITY
- Brainstem compression during herniation leads to **agitation, restlessness or confusion** followed by **lethargy** progressing to frank coma.
- **Anisocoria, ptosis, impaired extraocular movements** occur initially as the third cranial nerve is compressed during uncal herniation. As herniation progresses, the pupil becomes **dilated and nonreactive**.
- **Pinpoint pupils** (2 mm) develop with central transtentorial herniation. Light reflexes become difficult to detect. As herniation progresses, both pupils become **midpoint and lose light responsiveness**.
- A unilateral Babinski's sign develops early with uncal herniation, followed by hemiparesis and then by bilateral decerebrate posturing as the herniation progresses. **Decorticate posturing** is not always seen.
- **Increased motor tone** followed by **decorticate** and then **decerebrate posturing** occurs with central transtentorial herniation.
- **Flaccid quadriplegia** occurs with cerebellotonsilar herniation due to bilateral compression of the corticospinal tracts.

## ULTRASOUND
- Optic nerve sheath diameter ≥ 6 mm 3 mm behind the eye suggests increased ICP

## MANAGEMENT
### 1. Cervical-Spine Stabilisation?
- **Indication**: potential cervical spine injury in the setting of trauma.
- **Stabilization of the cervical spine**, manually initially.

### 2. Oxygen?
- **Indication**: SpO₂ < 95%. As PaO₂ decreases, cerebral vessels dilate to maintain oxygen delivery and vasogenic edema may ensue, thereby increasing ICP.
- **Oxygen 10 L/min** via mask with reservoir to maintain SpO₂ > 95%.

### 3. Ventilation?
- **Indication**: hypoventilation should be avoided in all patients with increased intracranial pressure. Hyperventilation is indicated for patients showing clear signs of increase ICP (e.g. fixed dilated pupil) as a bridge to more durable therapy and not as a routine measure in all head-injured patients.
- **Ventilate** with mask or via endotracheal tube.
- **Capnometry** or transcutaneous carbon dioxide measurement.
- Target EtCO₂ 5 kPa (37.5 mm Hg) as default.
- Target EtCO₂ 3.5 kPa (26 mm Hg) if fixed dilated pupil.

Here's the markdown transcription of the medical guidelines:

**4. Normal Saline?**
- Indication: SBP < 110 mm Hg. A MAP > 80 mm Hg, corresponding to a SBP > 100 mm Hg, should be maintained to avoid decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF), leading in turn to vasodilation, increased ICP and further decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) (penumbra areas are very susceptible to even temporary falls in SBP).
- Normal Saline 500 ml IV bolus. Hypotonic solutions should be avoided since they may exacerbate cerebral edema.

**5. Vasopressors?**
- Indication: if normal saline is insufficient to maintain SBP > 110 mm Hg
- Vasopressors are safe in most patients with increased ICP.

**6. Facilitate Venous Return**
- Elevating the head of the bed by 30° promotes cerebral venous outflow and is thought to decrease ICP without decreasing CPP or CBF
- Reverse Trendelenburg position is an alternative to elevating the head of the bed
- Head neutral position: excessive flexion/rotation of the cervical spine should be corrected
- Cervical collars should be removed to avoid venous congestion

**7. Seizure Management**
- Indication: suspected seizure. Seizures increase cerebral metabolic rate and ICP.
- Diazepam 10 mg IV (0.2 mg/kg) or Midazolam 10 mg IM (0.2 mg/kg) initially (see Status Epilepticus for further management).

**8. Fever Management**
- Indication: temperature > 37.7°C. Fever should be avoided since it increases metabolic rate by 10% per degree Celsius and is a potent vasodilator.
- Paracetamol 1 g IV and/or physical cooling measures.
- Consider antibiotics in the setting of suspected infection.

**9. Hypertonic Saline?**
- Indication: unconscious + fixed dilated pupil (i.e. impending brain hernation). Osmotic agents exert their effect by extracting water from the neurons where the blood-brain-barrier is intact. Blood hyperosmolarity must be maintained until the underlying cause has been addressed, otherwise the gradient for water transfer is reversed, resulting in rebound increase in intracranial pressure.
- Add 20 ml of NaCl concentrate 4 mmol/ml (i.e. 80 mmol) to a 250 ml bag of normal saline (NaCl 0.9%). This yields a 270 ml solution containing 120 mmol of NaCl, i.e. a 2.94% NaCl solution. Administer 275 ml IV of NaCl 3% over 5 minutes (2-4 ml/kg for children).

**10. Corticosteroids?**
- Indication: known brain tumor or CNS-infection (but not traumatic brain injury, stroke)
- Betamethasone 4 mg/ml 4 ml IV

**11. Head CT**
- Indication: all.
- Urgent non-contrast head CT

# Myxedema Coma

## INTRODUCTION
Myxedema coma is severy hypothyroidism leading to slowing of function in multiple organs. The condition is a medical emergency that should be treated based on clinical suspicion prior to obtaining blood test results. Mortality is high even with treatment.

## CONTEXT
Typically, an older patient with known hypothyroidism who has:
* stopped taking his or her thyroid medication
* been exposed to an "insult", e.g. an infection, injury, myocardial infarction, exposure to cold, surgery, stroke, opioid medication
* presents because of confusion with lethargy and obtundation

## ABCDE
| A | • Thyroidectomy scar may be present |
|---|---|
| B | • Hypoventilation due to central depression of respiratory drive |
| C | • Bradycardia<br>• Diastolic hypertension with narrow pulse pressure<br>• Hypotension occurs sometimes |
| D | • Altered level of consciousness ranging from confusion to coma<br>• Focal or generalized seizures may occur |
| E | • Cold dry skin<br>• Swelling/puffiness of the eyelids, face, tongue, hands resulting from abnormal deposits of albumin and mucin in the skin and other tissues<br>• Hypothermia due to decreased thermogenesis accompanying decreased metabolism; the patient may lack a febrile response to infection |

## BEDSIDE TESTS
| BBT | • Hypoglycemia from hypothyroidism or concurrent adrenal insufficiency<br>• Hyponatremia in half of patients<br>• Elevated Creatinine<br>• Hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis |
|---|---|
| US | • Pericardial fluid may be present, but ventricular function is rarely compromised |

## MANAGEMENT
1. **Blood Tests**
* TSH, T3, T4, ACTH, Cortisol

2. **Hydrocortisone**
* Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV

3. **Antibiotics**
* Piperacillin-Tazobactam

4. **Hypothermia**
* Warm blankets

5. **Levothyroxin**
* 400 μg IV
* An alternative is 1 mg worth of crushed tablets (Levaxin) via gastric tube; however, in the setting of myxedema coma, uptake from the gastrointestinal tract may be impaired

# Status Epilepticus

## INTRODUCTION
Status epilepticus has been classically defined as > 30 min of continuous or intermittent seizures without recovery of consciousness. From a practical standpoint, continuous or intermittent seizures lasting > 5 min warrant pharmacological therapy, since the seizures are less likely to spontaneously terminate and more likely to cause neuronal damage

Eclampsia refers to a generalized tonic-clonic seizure occurring in a patient with signs of preeclampsia, in the absence of other neurological conditions that could account for the seizure. Roughly 60% of eclampsia cases occur prepartum, 20% intrapartum, and 20% postpartum, of which 90% occur during the first week since delivery

## ABCDE
| | |
|---|---|
| A | • Trauma to the head and neck may precede or follow loss of consciousness<br>• Lateral tongue bite SN 24% SP 99% for tonic clonic epileptic seizure. |
| B | • Hypoxia is a reversible cause of seizure. SpO₂ can be falsely elevated in CO poisoning.<br>• Bradypnea may be present, tachypnea may be a response to lactic acidosis. |
| C | • Tachycardia may present |
| D | • Consciousness is absent in generalized seizures and is present or impaired with a focal seizure. Bilateral motor movements with preserved consciousness suggests psychogenic pseudoseizure.<br>• Eye movements: blinking, shaky eye movement and gaze deviation may be the only clue to a non-convulsive status epilepticus<br>• Limb movements: sustained, rhythmic, bilateral tonic and clonic movements suggest generalized convulsive status epilepticus. Jerking movements restricted to one area of the body suggests a focal motor seizure. |
| E | • Fever may suggest that the seizure is triggered by an infection<br>• Signs of meningismus may suggest meningoencephalitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage.<br>• Petechiae suggest meningitis or a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.<br>• Body examination may reveal signs of trauma secondary to loss of consciousness.<br>• Warm, dry skin may suggest an anticholinergic toxidrome (e.g. tricyclic overdose). |

## BEDSIDE TESTS
| | |
|---|---|
| BBT | • Hypoglycemia is the most common metabolic cause of seizure activity; it may also result from prolonged seizure activity.<br>• Hypoxia, hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia are other metabolic causes of seizure.<br>• Lactic acidosis from skeletal muscle is often present; in a third of adults in status epilepticus, the arterial pH falls below 7.0. The absence of lactic acidosis argues against a true generalized seizure and suggests pseudoseizure. |

# MANAGEMENT
1. **Cardiac Arrest / Shock?**
- Convulsions may be the result of cerebral hypoxia resulting from severely compromised cerebral perfusion. Cardiac arrest can be misdiagnosed as "post-ictal state," syncope (e.g. secondary to a massive pulmonary embolism) can be misdiagnosed as "seizure"

2. **Cervical Spine Stabilization?**
- Head trauma resulting in damage to the cervical spine may be the primary cause of the seizure or occur as a result of seizure-induced loss of consciousness

3. **Airway Opening Maneuvers?**
- Jaw-thrust +/- head tilt
- Nasopharyngeal airway as needed to maintain a patent upper airway. Insertion of an oral pharyngeal tube may be impossible and may damage teeth and tongue.

4. **Anticipate Vomiting**
- In the event of vomiting, the patient should be rolled into the decubitus position
- The use of suction during seizure activity may injure teeth, tongue or lips

5. **Oxygen**
- Indication: all
- Oxygen ≥ 10 L/min via mask with reservoir

6. **Ventilation?**
- Indication: low respiratory rate and/or tidal volumes
- Bag-valve-mask ventilation to maintain minute ventilation

7. **First Line Anticonvulsant Therapy**
- Indication: continuous or intermittent seizures lasting > 5 min.

| | Adults | Children |
|---|---|---|
| IV access | • Diazepam 10 mg IV push<br>• Lorazepam 4 mg IV push | • Diazepam 0.2 mg/kg IV push<br>• Lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV push |
| No IV access | • Midazolam 10 mg IM<br>• Midazolam 10 mg buccal<br>• Midazolam 10 mg IN<br>• Diazepam 10-20 mg PR | • Midazolam 0.2 mg/kg IM<br>• Midazolam 0.5 mg/kg buccal<br>• Midazolam 0.2 mg/kg IN<br>• Diazepam 0.5 mg/kg PR |

- A second dose of IV benzodiazepine can be administered if the first IV dose does not lead to cessation of seizure activity

8. **Crystalloid +/- Vasopressor?**
- Indication: SBP < 120 mm Hg (cerebral blood flow is pressure-dependent during seizures)
- Crystalloid 500 ml IV bolus, push-dose pressor if necessary

**12. Further Management**
• Blood tests: Na, Ca, Mg, glucose, complete blood count, anticonvulsant levels if indicated.
• Head CT is indicated following a first seizure and in the setting of posttraumatic seizure.
• EEG to diagnosis non-convulsive status in patients who do not return to a normal level of consciousness post-seizure and for patients who received neuromuscular blocking agents.
• Hyperthermia should be treated (increases brain metabolism).

# Thyroid Storm

## INTRODUCTION
Thyroid storm is a life-threatening condition characterised by an exaggeration of the usual symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The fundamental pathophysiology is an over-expression and increased sensitivity of adrenergic receptors to endogenous catecholamines. There are no accepted clinical tools for diagnosing thyroid storm. Some authors argue that altered mental status is the key feature.

## CONTEXT
Patients with untreated hyperthyroidism combined with a precipitating event

**Untreated hyperthyroidism** (undiagnosed or non-compliance with thyroid medications)
- Graves' disease (most patients)
- Toxic multinodular goiter
- Solitary toxic adenoma
- Destructive thyroiditis associated with checkpoint inhibitors

**Precipitating event:**
- thyroid or nonthyroidal surgery, trauma
- myocardial infarction, infection
- acute iodine load (overdose of thyroid hormone, amiodarone use, exposure to iodine-containing contrast)
- parturition, diabetic ketoacidosis

### ABCDE
| Category | Symptoms |
|----------|-----------|
| A | • Goiter may be present |
| B | • Tachypnea<br>• Hypoxemia may result from cardiogenic pulmonary edema |
| C | • Tachycardia at rates exceeding 140 bpm<br>• Cardiac arrhythmias (e.g. atrial fibrillation) may occur<br>• Elevated blood pressure<br>• Hypotension and death from cardiovascular collapse may occur |
| D | • Agitation, anxiety<br>• Seizure<br>• Delirium, psychosis, stupor, or coma |
| E | • Fever > 40°C<br>• Ophthalmopathy (in the presence of Graves' disease)<br>• Lid lag<br>• Hand tremor<br>• Warm and moist skin<br>• Jaundice (from hepatic failure)<br>• Nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea |

### BEDSIDE TESTS
| Test | Results |
|------|----------|
| BBT | • Mild hyperglycemia (due to catecholamine-induced inhibition of insulin release)<br>• Mild hypercalcemia (due to hemoconcentration and enhanced bone resorption) |
| EKG | • Sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation |

# MANAGEMENT

1. **Benzodiazepine**
- Indication: extreme agitation
- Midazolam 2.5 mg IV or Midazolam 5 mg IM. Repeat as needed q10min.

2. **Crystalloid?**
- Indication: hypotension
- Contraindication: pulmonary edema
- Ringer's acetate 1 L IV over 30 min (cold), correct electrolyte deficiencies

3. **Beta-blocker**
- Indication: to control the symptoms resulting from increased adrenergic tone and prevent peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. A non-selective beta-blocker is therefore preferred.
- Contraindications: acute decompensated heart failure with systolic dysfunction. Use with caution in the setting of severe asthma
- Options:
  - Propranolol 1 mg IV over 10 min, titrating 1-3 mg q10min until heart rate < 100 bpm
  - Esmolol 0,5 mg/kg IV followed by 50-300 mcg/kg/min infusion
  - Metoprolol 1 mg IV, repeat as needed x 8
- Propranolol 60-80 mg PO q6h, can also be given via nasogastric tube

4. **Thionamide**
- Indication: inhibits de novo thyroid hormone production and T4 to T3 conversion (PTU)
- Contraindication: exogenous cause (iatrogenic, overdose). Sufficient to block adrenergic activity with beta-blocker and T4 to T3 conversion with corticosteroids.
- Options:
  - Propylthiouracil (Tiotil) 200 mg PO q4h, can also be given via nasogastric tube
  - Methimazole 20-30 mg PO q4-6h, can also be given via nasogastric tube

5. **Corticosteroids**
- Indication: relative adrenal insufficiency, decreases T4 to T3 conversion
- Hydrocortisone (Solucoref) 100 mg IV q6h or Dexamethasone 2-4 mg IV q6h

6. **Cooling**
- Indication: hyperthermia
- Acetaminophen, cool IV fluids, ice packs and/or cooling blankets

7. **Precipitant**
- Search for and treat the precipitant e.g. infection, myocardial infarction, diabetic ketoacidosis

8. **Blood Tests**
- TSH, T4, T3

9. **Admission**
- ICU. Risk for cardiovascular decompensation, mortality is substantial
- Iodine is administered at least 1 hour after thionamide therapy to inhibit thyroid hormone release. If iodine is administered too early, it will be used as substrate for hormone synthesis in patients with toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter.

# Hyperthermia

## INTRODUCTION
- Hyperthermia refers to elevation in body temperature due to failure of thermoregulation. There is a risk of thermal tissue injury. Temp > 40.5°C = severe hyperthermia
- Fever refers to elevation in body temperature due to pyrogen-triggered reset of the thermal set-point in the hypothalamus. Fever does not cause physiologic damage
- Heat stroke is defined as elevated core body temperature associated with central neurological dysfunction in the setting of large environmental heat load. It is categorized as "classic" (nonexertional; elderly, comorbidities) and exertional (athletes, military recruits)

## MANAGEMENT
### 1. Pharmacological Measures
- Benzodiazepines first line for agitation

### 2. Surface Cooling
- Remove all clothing
- Spray unclosed patient with lukewarm water and direct fan for evaporative cooling
- Ice bath; place patient in body bag, add buckets of ice and tap water up to axillary lines

### 3. Internal Cooling
- Infusion of 1 L of chilled crystalloid (4°C) decreases the core body temperature by 1°C

### 4. Tests
- Glucose, electrolytes, acid-base, hemoglobin, leukocytes, thrombocytes, liver tests, INR, aPTT, creatinine kinase, myoglobin (hyperthermia can cause hepatic failure, DIC, rhabdo)
- Consider salicylate levels, paracetamol, TSH/T4, blood cultures

### 5. Target Temperature
- Drop core temperature to 38-39°C as fast as possible
- Then stop active cooling and monitoring temperature (e.g. with bladder probe)

## Differential Diagnosis of Increased Body Temperature

| Pathophysiology | Examples |
|----------------|-----------|
| Increased heat gain | • High ambient heat<br>• Sun exposure (heat transfer through radiation) |
| Increased heat generation | • Infections, stroke (via the hypothalamus)<br>• Strenuous exercise, seizures<br>• Malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome<br>• Toxins: sympathomimetics, serotoninergics, anticholinergics, salicylates, lithium<br>• Hyperthyroidism (thyroid storm), pheochromocytoma |
| Decreased heat loss | • Intravascular volume depletion (e.g. from dehydration, diarrhea)<br>• Impaired circulation (e.g. from cardiac disease, atherosclerosis)<br>• Occlusive, vapor-impermeable clothing (prevents heat loss through convection and evaporation) skin disease (e.g. scleroderma)<br>• Anticholinergics (impaired sweating)<br>• Humid environment (decreased evaporative heat loss)<br>• Reduced air flow (inside car; decreased heat loss through convection) |

- Mild hypothermia: core temperature 32-35°C
- Moderate hypothermia: core temperature 28-32°C
- Severe hypothermia: core temperature < 28°C
- Profound hypothermia: core temperature < 20-24°C

## MANAGEMENT
### 1. Risk for Arrhythmias
- Cardiac monitoring. Avoid jostling the patient.

- **Indications:** severe hypothermia and refractory moderate hypothermia
- Isotonic crystalloid 40-42°C IV
- Warmed humidified oxygen
- Irrigation of pleural and/or peritoneal cavities with warmed isotonic crystalloid
- Extracorporeal warming (ECMO, cardiac bypass)

### 3. Active External Rewarming?
- **Indications:** moderate hypothermia and refractory mild hypothermia

- Rewarm torso before rewarming extremities

### 4. Passive External Rewarming?
- **Indication:** mild hypothermia
- Remove all wet clothing
- Cover with blankets
- Place in warm room

## Differential Diagnosis of Hypothermia

| Pathophysiology | Examples |
|----------------|-----------|
| Environmental/iatrogenic | - Cold environment<br>- Wet environment (increased heat loss through conduction)<br>- Cold infusions |
| Impaired heat generation: central (hypothalamus) | - Cerebrovascular accident, central nervous system trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hypothalamic failure, neoplasm, hypopituitarism<br>- Anorexia nervosa<br>- Alcoholic or diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis<br>- Hypoadrenalism, myxedema coma<br>- Major infection (bacterial, viral, parasitic) |
| Impaired heat generation: peripheral | - Shock<br>- Extreme physical exertion, hypoglycemia, malnutrition<br>- Advanced age with inactivity<br>- Parkinson's disease<br>- Cholinergic toxidrome |
| Increased heat loss | - Acute spinal cord transection<br>- Burns |

# Burn & Inhalation Injury

## INTRODUCTION

| Degree | Anatomy | Clinical Features |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| 1st degree | • Epidermis | • No blisters, sunburn appearance<br>• Intact CRT, painful |
| 2nd degree, superficial | • Epidermis<br>• Superficial dermis | • Wet, pink, clear blisters<br>• Intact CRT, very painful |
| 2nd degree, deep | • Epidermis<br>• Deep dermis, sweat glands, hair follicles | • Less wet, red, hemorrhagic blisters<br>• Impaired CRT, +/- painful |

| 4th degree | • Epidermis & entire dermis<br>• Fat, bone, and/or muscle | • Brown, charred<br>• Insensate |

## MANAGEMENT

**1. Oxygen?**
- Indication: patients with potential inhalation injuries (CO can lead to false normal SpO₂)
- Oxygen 10-15 L/min via mask with reservoir, or 100% FiO₂ via CPAP/endotracheal tube

**2. Analgesia?**
- Indication: second degree burns are very painful
- Morphine 2-4 mg IV boluses (0.1 mg/kg for children) or Fentanyl 50 μg/ml 1 ml (50 μg) in each nostril for adults (1.5 μg/kg corresponding to 0.15 ml for each 10 kg in each nostril) or S-Ketamine 25 mg/ml 0.3 mg/kg IM

**3. Crystalloid**
- Indication: all initially. Subsequent rate should be guided by urinary output
- Ringer (warm) 1 L (20 ml/kg) IV (or via IO through burnt skin if necessary) over 30 min

**4. Early Endotracheal Intubation?**
- Indications: stridor, resp distress, new onset hoarseness, oropharyngeal blisters or edema, deep burns lower face/neck. Using nasopharyngoscope: supraglottic area beefy red/sooty
- Use 7.5 tube to allow for later bronchoscopy. Consider fiberoptic intubation

**5. Irrigation?**
- Indication: prolonged irrigation with water/NS cornerstone of chemical burn management
- Contraindications: burning elemental metal (Na, Li, K, Mg, Al, Ca) fragments
- Dry chemical particles should be brushed away before irrigation
- Cooling of thermal burns with tap water at 12° to 18°C or the application of moist dressings is only indicated during the first 20 min post-burn (risk of inducing hypothermia)

**6. Blood & Urine Tests**
- Blood gases with co-oximetry (CO-Hb, Met-Hb)
- Electrolytes, potassium, lactate
- Myoglobin and CK if rhabomyolysis is suspected
- Cyanid levels can be ordered to confirm cyanid intoxication at a later time
- Medication/alcohol/toxin levels in the setting of suspected poisoning
- Pregnancy test for fertile women

**7. CPAP?**
- Indication: carbon monoxide poisoning (CO-Hb > 10%). The mainstay of treatment is 100% O₂. Delivering O₂ via CPAP insures an FiO₂ of 100% +/- more rapid CO washout.
- CPAP with 100% oxygen and 5 cm H₂O

**8. Hydroxycobalamin?**
- Suggestive findings: suspected CN poisoning—enclosed space, burnt textiles/plastics, altered mental status, unexplained hypotension, soot in mouth or nose, lactate > 8 mmol/L
- Hydroxycobalamin (Cyanokit®) 5 g (200 ml) IV over 15 min (3 ml/kg for children)

**9. Methemoglobinemia?**
- Indication: Met-Hb > 30% or Met-Hb 20-30% + symptomatic (e.g. lethargy)
- Methylene blue 2 mg/kg IV over 5 min

**10. Estimate Second and Third Degree Burn Surface Area**
- Body surface area (BSA) of small burns: area covered by the patient's palm and fingers correspond to 1% of BSA. For larger burns, use "rule of nines" or Lund-Browder diagram

| | Head | Front torso | Back | Arm | Leg | Perineum |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Adult | 9% | 18% | 18% | 9% | 18% | 1% |
| 1 year old | 18% | 18% | 18% | 9% | 13.5% | 1% |

- Pictures may be taken and sent to burn center
- Electrical burns may yield deceptively little superficial evidence of trauma despite the presence of substantial deep injury

**11. Escharotomy eller Fasciotomy?**
- Indications: inability to adequately ventilate due to chest eschar restriction, suspected extremity compartment syndrome; burns do not necessarily need to be circumferential
- Escharotomy: bilateral midaxillary incisions with scalpel/cautery through burned skin to fat from axilla to lower ribs, with cross-incision at clavicular line + thorax/abd junction
- Fasciotomy: incision down to and through muscle fascia to expose the muscle

**12. Dressing**
- First degree burns: no local care other than topical anesthetics
- Second degree burns: occlusive dressings that support a moist healing environment (e.g. Mepitel or Mepilex Ag) +/- antibiotic ointment. Dressing can be left on for 2-3 days
- Blisters < 6 mm left intact, otherwise snip the top with scissors & remove dead tissue
- Plastic wrap prevents hypothermia and loss of moisture

**13. Prevent Hypothermia**
- Indications: all

**14. Urinary Bladder Catheter**
- Indications: severe burns; to follow diuresis/guide fluid therapy +/- measure temperature
- Consider using a temperature-sensing indwelling urinary catheter

**15. Consider**
- Trauma, tetanus booster, poisoning, child/elder abuse

**16. Admission**
- Transfer to burn unit depending on total BSA (> 20% adult, > 10% child), burn depth, areas involved (especially the face, hands, feet, perineum, joints), cause of the burn (electrical, chemical), presence of inhalation injury and the patient's age and comorbidities
- In CO poisoning, discuss hyperbaric oxygen with regional poison control center

# Poisoning

## INTRODUCTION
Most patients with suspected poisoning do not require resuscitation, but for the sake of clarity, all material pertaining to poisoning features in the "**Resuscitation**" side of the compendium.

## MANAGEMENT
### 1. Severe Agitation?
• De-escalation measures: attempt to calm the patient through verbal/non-verbal measures
• Call for help in the setting of severe agitation not responding to de-escalation measures
• Midazolam 5 mg IM; reevaluate after 10 minutes, repeat if necessary

### 2. ABCDE + Bedside Blood Tests (acid-base, electrolytes . . . ) + EKG
Patients presenting with "poisoning" may suffer from conditions other than poisoning (e.g. intracranial hemorrhage, fractures, self-inflicted wounds) and may be unwilling or unable to provide a reliable history. The ABCDE, bedside blood tests and EKG allow for the identification of toxidromes, signs of trauma and other conditions

### 3. Toxidrome Treatment?
• Sympathomimetic: Diazepam 10 mg IV. Avoid beta-blockers<br>
• Anticholinergic: Diazepam 10 mg IV. Physostigmin in severe cases<br>
• Serotonergic: Diazepam 10 mg IV. Cyproheptadine 12 mg PO in severe cases<br>
• Sedative: Supportive care. Flumazenil may precipitate seizures<br>
• Opioid: Naloxone 0.1 mg IV or needed to maintain ventilation<br>
• Cholinergic: Atropine 2-5 mg IV (50 μg/kg in children), Oxims in selected cases<br>
• Na Channel Block: NaHCO3 2 mmol/kg. See Sodium Channel Blockade Toxidrome<br>
• K Channel Block: See Potassium Channel Blockade Toxidrome

**7. Measures to Decrease Absorption?**
- Activated charcoal 50 g (1g/kg in children) PO or via large bore nasogastric tube to unconscious patients after intubation is indicated within 1 hour of ingestion of a potentially toxic overdose. Beyond 1h after ingestion, activated charcoal may be considered for truly toxic ingestions requiring more that supportive care (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists). Activated charcoal is less effective at adsorbing metals (lithium, iron), alcohols (methanol, ethylene glycol), or petroleum distillates (white spirit). A repeated dose 2-4 hours later may be beneficial in cases of sustained-release compounds.
- Gastric lavage is indicated within 1 hour of ingestion of a highly toxic substance (e.g. calcium channel blocker and cyclic antidepressant).
- Whole bowel irrigation is indicated in cases of large ingestions of iron, lead, lithium, potassium or large ingestions of sustained-release cardiotoxic substances (e.g. calcium channel blockers). The dosage is 2 L/hr of a polyethylene glycol solution given via a nasogastric tube until the rectal effluents are clear.

**8. Thiamine?**
- Thiamine 500 mg IV over 30 min once or twice daily for 3 days for patients with chronic ethanol abuse who are deemed at increased risk for Wernicke's encephalopathy.
- Thiamine 500 mg IV over 30 min 3 times daily for 5 days in the setting of suspected Wernicke's encephalopathy.

**9. Bladder Scan & Catheterization?**
- Patients with anticholinergic toxidrome may suffer from urinary retention

**10. Additional Tests?**
- Acetaminophen for most patients with poisoning (+4 hr value if known ingestion time)
- Ethanol (present in 50% of deliberate poisonings in one series)
- Medication levels for certain specific overdoses?
- Ethylene glycol, methanol, salicylate if unclear metabolic acidosis, elevated anion gap
- Liver tests, INR if hepatotoxic ingestion, e.g. acetaminophen overdose
- Total CK + myoglobin if prolonged immobilization / seizures
- Urine toxicology screen seldom of immediated value but may impact further management
- Pregnancy test in fertile women
- Unenhanced CT for suspected 'body packing' or 'body stuffing'

**11. Admission for Somatic Treatment?**

**12. Psychiatric Assessment Prior to Discharge?**
- One systematic review concluded that overreliance on risk scales and the identification of risk factors is potentially dangerous, and no substitute for a comprehensive psychosocial assessment of the needs and risks specific to the individual patient.

**13. Contact Social Services or Guardians?**
- Is the patient the caretaker of a child?
- Is the patient a minor?
- Is the patient at high-risk of destroying his or her life through repeated drug overdoses?

# Sodium Channel Blockade Toxidrome

## INTRODUCTION
Certain drugs block the cardiac fast sodium channels that mediate the rapid influx of sodium into the cardiac myocyte during Phase 0 of the cardiac depolarization. The result is a prolonged Phase 0 manifesting on the EKG as a wide QRS complex. This phenomenon has been referred to as a 'membrane stabilizing effect,' a 'local anesthetic effect' and a 'quinidine-like effect'. Sodium channel blockade leads to other manifestation, prompting the acronym SALT to describe the sodium channel blockade syndrome:
- Shock
- Altered mental status
- Long QRS
- Terminal R wave in lead aVR

## SUBSTANCES THAT MAY INDUCE SODIUM CHANNEL BLOCKADE
- **Antiarrhythmics:**
  - Class Ia: Quinidine, Quinine, Procainamide, Disopyramid
  - Class Ic: Encainide, Flecainide, Propafenone, Moricizine
  - Class II: Propranolol
  - Class IV: Diltiazem, Verapamil
- **Antidepressant**: tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), e.g. Amitriptylin, Amoxapine, Desipramine, Imipramine, Nortriptyline; tetracyclic antidepressant Maprotiline
- **Antipsychotics**: Loxapine, phenothiazines, thioridazine
- **Antihistamines**: Diphehydramine
- **Local anesthetics**: Lidocaine, Bupivacaine
- **Miscellaneous**: Chloroquine, Carbamazepine, Cocaine, Citalopram, Lamotrigine, Hydrofluoric acid, Tetrodotoxin, Ciguatoxin

## ABCDE
| C | • Hypotension may result since Na channel blockers are also alpha adrenergic blockers. |
|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| D | • Altered mental status and seizures result from CNS sodium channel toxicity. |

## ELECTROCARDIOGRAM
| Rhythm | • Asystole, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular<br>fibrillation may occur in severe cases. |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| QRS | • Wide QRS complex. In some cases, the complex may assume the<br>morphology of a bundle branch block.

Here's the markdown transcription of the management protocol:

# MANAGEMENT

## 1. Crystalloids?
- **Indication:** hypotension
- Crystalloid 500 ml IV boluses (10 ml/kg).

## 2. NaHCO3?
- **Indication:** QRS > 100 msec or hypotension or ventricular arrhythmias. Sodium bicarbonate works by increasing the transmembrane Na gradient and alkalinising the blood.
- Sodium bicarbonate (50 mg/ml) 200 ml (120 mEq) IV push (3 ml/kg = 2 mEq/kg for a child). Can repeat after 5 min. An infusion of NaHCO3 is recommended afterwards.

## 3. Magnesium?
- **Indication:** ventricular arrhythmia despite two treatments with NaHCO3
- Magnesium 2.5 g (Addex-Magnesium 1 mmol/ml 10 ml) IV over 2 min.

## 4. Vasopressors?
- **Indication:** hypotension despite sodium bicarbonate and crystalloid therapy. To counter the alpha adrenergic antagonist effect of TCAs.
- Adrenalin 0.1 mg/ml 1 ml mixed with 9 ml NaCl. Administer 2 ml (20 μg) IV bolus. Repeat after 3 min if necessary. Noradrenalin infusion (see Emergency Medications).

## 5. Hyperventilation?
- **Indication:** if NaHCO3 therapy alone is insufficient to reach the target pH of 7.50-7.55. Acidosis increases free drug binding to the sodium channel.
- Hyperventilate to a target pH of 7.50 - 7.55.

## 6. Hypertonic Saline?
- **Indication:** hypotension refractory to NaHCO3, fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. Hypertonic saline works by increasing the transmembrane sodium gradient.
- Hypertonic saline 3% 100 ml IV bolus. Add NaCl Concentrate (Addex®-Natriumklorid) 4 mmol/L 10 ml to 100 ml of 0.9% NaCl, yielding a 110 ml solution containing 55 mmol NaCl (2.9%). Can administer twice with 10 min interval.

## 7. Seizures?
- **Indication:** seizure in the presence of sodium channel blockade toxicity
- Benzodiazepines followed by Propofol.
- Phenytoin contraindicated according to some sources since it may worsen cardiac toxicity.

## 8. Rescue Therapies?
- Lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg IV if ventricular arrhythmias despite above therapy
- Lipid emulsion (Intralipid® 20%) 100 ml (1.5 ml/kg) IV over 1 min. Can repeat twice
- Cardiac pacing
- Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

## 9. Further Management
- Concomitant potassium channel blockade? Many of the substances that block Na channels also K potassium channels. See Potassium Channel Blockade Toxidrome.
- **Admission:** patients should be admitted with continuous QRS monitoring.

# Potassium Channel Blockade Toxidrome

## INTRODUCTION
Certain drugs block cardiac potassium efflux channels, resulting in **prolongation of myocardial repolarization**. On the EKG, this effect translates into **QT interval prolongation** and potential T and U wave abnormalities.

The QT interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex until the end of the T wave. The QTc interval corrects for the effect of heart rate on the QT interval. The QTc can be estimated using **Bazett's formula**: QTc = QT / square root of the RR interval (in seconds). In the setting of concurrent cardiac sodium channel blockade, the estimated prolongation of the QRS complex should be subtracted from the QTc interval to estimate the **functional QTc interval**.

Prolongation of myocardial repolarization may result in early after-depolarization leading to ventricular tachycardia, most often torsade de pointes (TdP). Arrhythmias most commonly occur with a QTc > 500 msec, but the arrhythmia risk varies from drug to drug and patient to patient. Overdose with a single QT-prolonging drug does not as a rule lead to TdP in the absence of other risk factors, e.g. ingestion of another preparation that prolongs the QT interval or other QT prolonging factors, e.g. hypokalemia.

## SUBSTANCES THAT MAY INDUCE SODIUM CHANNEL BLOCKADE
Many compounds can block cardiac K channels (see www.qtdrugs.org), among others:
- **Antiarrhythmics**:
  - Class Ia: Quinidine, Quinine, Procainamide, Disopyramid
  - Class Ic: Encainide, Flecainide, Propafenone, Moricizine
  - Class III: Amiodarone, Sotalol, Ibutilide, Dofetilide
- **Antidepressants**:
  - Tricyclics: Amitriptylin, Amoxapine, Desipramine, Doxepin, Imipramine, Nortriptyline
  - Tetracyclic antidepressant: Maprotiline
  - Selective Serotonin Reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), e.g. Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Citalopram
- **Antipsychotics**, e.g. Haloperidol, Droperidol, Phenothiazines, Quetiapine, Risperidone
- **Antihistamines**, e.g. Diphenhydramine, Terfenadine, Loratidine
- **Antimicrobials**, e.g. Erythromycin, Fluoroquinolones, Ketoconazole, Hydroxychloroquine, Pentamidine
- **Miscellaneous**, e.g. Methadone

The following are 'high-risk' medications associated with a particularly high risk of TdP:
**Sotalol, Disopyramide, Chloroquine, Quinine, Methadone, Citalopram.**

# ELECTROCARDIOGRAM

| Rate | • Bradycardia in the setting of QTc prolongation is a risk factor for TdP. |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| QRS | • Compounds that also block cardiac sodium channels will prolong the QRS complex |
| T | • T-wave abnormalities associated with congenital long QT syndrome include larger, prolonged, bizarre-looking T waves; a notched, bifid or biphasic appearance; and T-wave alternans. It is unclear whether these findings are also present in medication-induced QT prolongation. |
| QT | • See Introduction |
| U | • U waves are positive deflections following the T waves. U-wave abnormalities associated with congenital long QT syndrome include prominent, bizarre-looking U waves and U-wave alternans. It is unclear whether these findings are also present in medication-induced QT prolongation. |

# MANAGEMENT

# Calcium Channel/Beta Blocker Toxidrome

## INTRODUCTION
Overdoses with calcium channel blockers (CCB) and beta blockers (BB) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These poisonings share common clinical features (e.g. atrioventricular blockade, bradyarrhythmias, hypotension) and common management aspects (calcium, glucagon, high-dose insulin) and are therefore considered together in this section.

## ABCDE

| Letter | Findings |
|--------|-----------|
| B | • **Respiratory depression** may be present, more often in patients with BB than with CCB intoxication<br>• **Pulmonary crackles** may be present in severe overdoses, especially if large volumes of crystalloids are infused during resuscitation. Pulmonary edema exceeding the degree of myocardial depression has been reported following overdose with Verapamil and Amlodipine, presumably due to precapillary vasodilation and increased transcapillary pressure |
| C | • **Hypotension** may be seen in CCB overdose<br>• **Bradycardia** may be seen with overdoses of Verapamil and Diltiazem, but even with severe dihydropyridine poisoning<br>• **Tachycardia** may be seen following intoxication with dihydropyridines |
| D | • **CNS depression** may occur, more often in patients with BB intoxication than in patients with CCB intoxication. CCB-poisoned patients may maintain a surprisingly clear mental status, possibly due to the neuroprotective effects of CCBs, unless cerebral perfusion becomes critically limited due to systemic hypoperfusion |
| E | • **Flush** may be present in patients with dihydropyridine intoxication due to systemic vasodilation |

## BEDSIDE TESTS

| Test | Findings |
|------|-----------|
| BBT | • **Hyperglycemia** may be present in severe CCB due to blocking of insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells via a calcium-dependent pathway<br>• **Hypoglycemia** or euglycemia may result from beta-blocker toxicity<br>• **Lactic acidosis** may result from systemic hypoperfusion<br>• **Ketoacidosis** may result from decreased insulin production with severe CCB intoxication<br>• **Hyperkalemia** may be present in patients with BB toxicity<br>• **Hypokalemia** may be observed in severe CCB overdoses<br>• **Serum calcium levels**, total or ionized, are usually normal in CCB overdoses |
| EKG | • **Atrioventricular blocks** in varying degrees may be present with CCB overdoses<br>• **Junctional rhythms** occur with severe overdoses of Verapamil or Diltiazem<br>• **Ventricular escape rhythms** occur with severe overdoses of Verapamil or Diltiazem |
| US | • **Decreased contractility** would be expected in the setting of severe overdoses of CCB and BB |

# MANAGEMENT

One expert suggests sequential treatment (steps 1-7) in the setting of mild hypotension and simultaneous treatment (steps 1-7) in the setting of severe hypotension / bradycardia.

**1. Ringer's Acetate**
- Ringer's Acetate up to 2 liters IV bolus

**2. Atropine**
- Atropine 1 mg IV (0.02 mg/kg in children with a minimum dose of 0.1 mg) in the setting of bradycardia. Can repeate dose every 3 minutes to a total of 3 mg (0.03-0.04 mg/kg)

**3. Calcium**
- Calcium Gluconate 100 mg/ml 30 ml IV over 5 min (0.3-0.6 ml/kg). Can be repeated every 15th min up to three times. OR:
- Calcium Chloride 100 mg/ml 20 ml IV. More caustic, may cause tissue necrosis if it extravasates. Given ideally via a central catheter or a large-bore antecubital peripheral line

**4. Noradrenalin**
- The initial rate of Noradrenalin infusion is 0.1 μg/kg/min. Titrate up to 1 μg/kg/min

**5. Insulin-Glucose**
- Glucose 500 mg/ml 50 ml IV bolus followed by regular insulin 1 U/kg IV
- Thereafter insulin infusion 1 U/kg/h and Glucose 100 mg/ml infusion 200 ml/h
- Measure glucose every 15 min and adjust glucose infusion
- Measure potassium every 15 min and initiate potassium infusion if K < 3.5 mEq/L
- Titrate up insulin infusion by 0.25-0.5 U/kg/h every 15 min based on POCUS findings; patients may require up to 10 U/kg/h

**6. Glucagon**
- Glucagon 5 mg IV (50 μg/kg to children). Can repeat after 10 min. Highly emetogenic.

**7. Lipid Therapy**
- Lipid emulsion (Intralipid® 20%) 100 ml IV over 1 min (1 ml/kg for child)
- An infusion of 0.25-0.5 mL/kg/min is given thereafter for 30-60 min

**8. Rescue Therapy**
- If the above measures are insufficient to correct cardiovascular collapse, consider transvenous pacing (does not improve inotropy), intraoartic balloon pump, ECMO

**9. Further Management**
- Gastric lavage for patients who present within 1-2 hours after a dangerous intoxication
- Activated charcoal should be administered (50 g for adults, 1 g/kg for children) unless the patient may not be able to protect their airway
- Whole bowel irrigation should be considered in the setting of sustained- or extended-release preparations
- Patients should be admitted to a setting with continuous cardiovascular monitoring. Patients who have taken sustained-release CCB should be observed for > 24 hours.

# Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST)

## INTRODUCTION
Local anesthetics that inadvertently are injected into the arterial or venous circulation can have systemic toxic effects on the cardiovascular system and the central nervous system. Local anesthetics block voltage-gated sodium channels; toxicity results from the blockage of cardiac sodium channels and the effect of LAs on thalamocortical neurons. The typical progression of systemic toxicity (60% of cases) is:
- central nervous system excitation
- central nervous system inhibition
- cardiovascular excitation
- cardiovascular inhibition and arrest in extreme cases

## CONTEXT
LAST occurs during the administration of regional anaesthesia, when a bolus of local anesthetic enters the arterial or venous circulation. Symptom onset is usually within 1-5 min of injection but may range from 30 sec to 60 min. Symptoms include:
- circumoral and/or tongue numbness, metallic taste, visual/auditory disturbance (neuroexcitatory symptoms)
- light-headedness, dizziness

## ABCDE
| B | • Respiratory depression |
|---|---|
| C | • Tachycardia and hypertension<br>• Bradycardia and hypotension<br>• Ventricular tachyarrhythmias, asystole |
| D | • Drowsiness, disorientation<br>• Severe agitation<br>• Loss of consciousness, coma<br>• Seizures, muscle twitching |

## BEDSIDE TESTS
| EKG | • Bradycardia<br>• Wide QRS complexes due to sodium channel blockade<br>• Ventricular tachyarrhythmias, asystole |
|---|---|

## MANAGEMENT
**1. Stop the Injection**
- **Indication:** onset of symptoms suggestive of LAST (e.g. circumoral numbness)

**2. Cardiac Arrest?**
- **Indication:** unconscious + not breathing + no definite pulse
- **Adrenalin:** limit adrenalin boluses to ≤ 1 mcg/kg IV since adrenalin may limit the efficacy of lipid therapy. Give small boluses of 10-100 mcg.
- **Amiodarone:** administer in the setting of ventricular arrhythmias
- **ECMO:** call for ECMO early with LAST requiring CPR. ECMO may require until the LOA diffuse from the cardiac sodium channel receptors.

Here's the markdown transcription of the medical document:

**3. Oxygen**
- Indication: all patients. Hypoxia potentiates LA toxicity.
- High flow oxygen via mask

**4. Ventilation?**
- Indication: hypoventilation. Acidemia potentiates LA toxicity. Hyperventilation may help by increasing pH.
- Ventilate using bag-valve-mask

**5. Lipid Emulsion**
- Indication: seizures or impending seizures, or signs of cardiovascular toxicity (arrhythmias, severe hypotension, or cardiac arrest)
- Lipid bolus: 20% 1.5 mL/kg (100 ml for a 70 kg adult) IV over 1 min
- Repeat boluses: give up to a maximum of 2 repeat boluses at 5-minute intervals if cardiovascular instability
- Infusion: 15 mL/kg/hr = 0.25 mg/kg/min = 1000 mL/hr for a 70 kg adult. The infusion rate can be doubled if persistent cardiovascular instability. Continue infusion for at least 10 minutes after hemodynamic stability is achieved.
- Maximum cumulative dose: 12 mL/kg (800 ml for 70 kg adult).

**6. Seizures?**
- Benzodiazepines as first line (e.g. Diazepam 10 mg IV [0.2 mg/kg])
- Thiopentone 1 mg/kg or phenobarbital as second line
- Avoid Phenytoin (which blocks sodium channels) and Propofol (cardiodepressant)

**7. Sodium Bicarbonate?**
- Indication: there is little in the literature about sodium bicarbonate use, even though it is advocated for sodium channel receptor blockade in poisonings such as TCA-overdose. The literature recommends NaHCO₃ in the setting of wide QRS complex.
- Sodium bicarbonate (50 mg/ml) 200 ml (120 mEq) IV push for an adult (3 mL/kg = 2 mEq/kg for a child).

**8. Methylene blue**
- Indication: methemoglobinemia
- Methylene blue 1-2 mg/kg IV

# Diabetic Ketoacidosis

## INTRODUCTION
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) results from absolute insulin deficiency or from insulin deficiency relative to increased levels of counter-regulatory hormones (catecholamines, cortisol, glucagon and growth hormone) brought on by stress conditions such as sepsis, gastrointestinal illness or trauma. Decreased insulin and/or increased counter-regulatory hormone levels bring about:
* hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, osmotic diuresis, depletion of fluid and electrolytes from both the intra- and extracellular fluid compartments
* lipolysis, ketogenesis (β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) and metabolic acidosis

## ABCDE
| Letter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | • Acetone Fetor may be present, i.e. a breath smelling of acetone, sometimes described as the smell of nail polish remover or rotten fruit |
| B | • Kussmaul breathing, i.e. increased minute ventilation in compensation for respiratory acidosis through increased tidal volume and tachypnea<br>• Use of accessory respiratory muscles and intercostal recessions are in general absent, given that the patient's problem is not in the respiratory system |
| C | • Adults with DKA are hypo- or normotensive<br>• Children with DKA continue to maintain a **normal blood pressure** or have **high blood pressure** despite dehydration, presumably due to high catecholamine and ADH levels<br>• Tachycardia is typically present in children |
| D | • Usually alert but consciousness may be decreased with severe DKA |
| E | • Fever suggests infection or inflammation as the DKA precipitant<br>• Normo- and even hypothermia may be present despite an infectious precipitant |

## BEDSIDE TESTS
* Metabolic acidosis with a normal respiratory compensation
* Anion gap in DKA is typically increased to 20-30 mmol/L
* pH is low unless the patient has a concurrent metabolic alkalosis (due to intravascular volume depletion)
* Hyperglycemia in DKA is usually in the range of 25-30 mmol/L, higher if high carbohydrate containing beverages have been used to quench thirst.
* Euglycemic DKA: mildly elevated or normal glucose can occur in DKA if the patient is taking a Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, has poor oral intake or is pregnant
* Sodium (Na) is diluted by the osmotic effect of plasma glucose in the extracellular space. Corrected Na = Na + (Glucose - 5.6) x 2/5.6 (all values in mmol/L)
* Effective osmolarity (2 x Na) + glucose (mmol/L). The effective osmolarity in pediatric DKA is frequently in the range of 300 - 350 mmol/kg. The osmolarity in adult DKA is usually ≤ 320 mmol/kg
* Potassium levels are typically normal or elevated due to insulin deficiency, despite total body potassium depletion
* Point-of-care capillary beta-hydroxybutyrate level usually > 3 mmol/L in DKA

Here's the markdown transcription of the medical document:

Diagnostic criteria usually state that the glucose is ≥ 14 mmol/L (even though it can be less) and the venous pH is < 7.3 and the bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L (even though pH and bicarbonate can be normal or even elevated when a metabolic alkalosis is present). Pragmatic diagnostic criteria for DKA are as follows:

• Known diabetes or elevated glucose
• Point-of-care capillary beta-hydroxybutyrate ≥ 3 mmol/L or urine ketones ≥ 2+ or increased anion gap without another explanation than presence of ketones
• Ketones not due to alcohol abuse or starvation

**MANAGEMENT**

1. **Airway Management?**
• Nasogastric tube placement and nasogastric suction prevents pulmonary aspiration in the obtunded patient and can remove recently ingested fruit juice and sweetened soft drinks that can exacerbate the hyperglycemia when absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
• Endotracheal intubation should be avoided if possible since a transient rise in pCO₂ may cause cerebrospinal fluid pH to decrease and contribute to worsening of cerebral edema.

2. **Shock/Severe Volume Depletion?**
• Adults with shock/severe volume depletion: 0.9% saline 1-2 L/hr IV during first 1-2 hrs.
• Children with shock: 0.9% saline 10 ml/kg aliquot boluses. >3 boluses rarely required.
• Children with severe volume depletion: 0.9% saline 10-20 ml/kg over 1-2 hours. Under other circumstances, large amounts of initial fluid therapy should be avoided (increased risk of cerebral edema).

3. **Fluid**
• Adults: Ringer's acetate 500 ml/hr over 4 hrs, then 250 ml/hr. The fluid deficit (3-6 liters) should be replaced within 24 hours.
• Children: the fluid deficit should be replaced evenly over 48 hours to reduce the risk of cerebral edema. The amount of fluid to be given is the sum of estimated fluid deficit (on average 7%) and the daily maintenance fluids for two days (100 ml/kg/d for the first 10 kg, 50 ml/kg/d for the next 10 kg, 20 ml/kg/d for each kilogram > 20 kg) minus the initial fluid bolus. Current weight in the ED should be used for calculations. For example, if a 15 kg child is 10% dehydrated, the child should receive 100 mg/kg x 15 kg (1500 ml) + 1250 ml (maintenance fluid day 1) + 1250 ml (maintenance fluid day 2) over 48 hours, i.e. roughly 80 ml/hr. The rate should seldom exceed 1.5 - 2 times the daily maintenance requirement rate. The initial fluid during the first 4-6 hours should be a crystalloid (e.g. normal saline, Ringer's lactate). The recommended fluid beyond that is 0.9% or 0.45% saline with added potassium, depending on the effective osmolality. Oral fluid may replace IV fluid when tolerated.

4. **Potassium**
• Adults: Potassium is added to the infusion once plasma potassium is < 5.3 and diuresis is established, usually with the second liter of saline. If the patient is normo- or hypokalemic on presentation, potassium should be added immediately, at a concentration of 10-40 mmol/L. The maximum rate of potassium infusion is 40 mmol/h (usually 20 mmol/h). The goal is to maintain a potassium between 4 and 5 mmol/L.
• Children: potassium should be added to the infusate (20-40 mmol/L) as long as the patient is not both hyperkalemic and anuric. The maximum recommended rate of potassium infusion is 0.5 mmol/kg/h.

Here's the markdown transcription of the medical document:

**5. Insulin**
- **Adults:** Insulin should be withheld if the potassium is < 3.3 mmol/L. There is no advantage with an initial insulin bolus, but an initial intravenous insulin bolus of 0.1 U/kg can be given as a bridge to insulin infusion. The standard infusion is 0.1 U/kg/h of regular or short-acting insulin (e.g. aspart [Novorapid®] 50 U in 49.5 ml 0.9% NaCl 7 ml/h). Equivalent duration of ketoacidosis was found with subcutaneous boluses of rapid-acting insulin analogues (lispro [Humalog®]) or aspart [Novorapid®]) (e.g. 0.2 U/kg SC every 2h) compared to short-acting insulin IV 0.1 U/kg/h, but intravenous insulin has a more rapid onset and a shorter half-life than subcutaneous insulin and is easier to titrate.

- **Children:** insulin should be administered 1-2 hours after the start of fluid therapy. An initial insulin bolus is not recommended, since it may increase the risk of cerebral edema and hypokalemia. The recommended initial insulin rate is 0.05-0.1 U/kg/hr IV. 50 units of regular insulin may be added to 50 ml of 0.9% saline to make a 1 U/ml solution. Hourly or two-hourly subcutaneous or intramuscular short- or rapid-acting insulin administration is an option in patients with preserved peripheral circulation, at roughly 0.1 U/hr.

- Once the ketoacidosis has resolved (pH > 7.3, HCO3 > 15 mmol/L, closure of the anion gap) and oral intake is tolerated, usual S/C insulin therapy may be resumed. An overlap of 1-2 hours between intravenous and subcutaneous insulin is recommended.

**6. Glucose**
- **Adults:** 5% glucose infusion should be initiated, targeting a plasma glucose level of 12-14 mmol/L if the glucose is < 15 mmol/L and residual metabolic acidosis is present.
- **Children:** 5% glucose, even 10% glucose, should be added to the 0.45 - 0.9% saline infusion to prevent hypoglycemia when the glucose level has fallen to < 15 mmol/L and residual metabolic acidosis is present. Glucose may also be added to the infusion if the blood glucose level falls very rapidly (> 5 mmol/L/hr) following initial fluid therapy.

**7. Precipitant**
- Inadequate insulin therapy and infection are the most common precipitants. Consider giving empirical antibiotics.
- Recurrent episodes of DKA in the absence of fever / vomiting suggest non-compliance.

**8. Admission and Monitoring**
- **Adults:** assessments as often as every 2 hours. Patients with mild metabolic derangement who tolerate PO fluids do not require admission.
- **Children** with severe DKA (long symptom duration, hypoperfusion, depressed consciousness) or with increased risk of developing cerebral edema (< 5 years old, severe acidosis, low pCO2, high blood urea nitrogen) should be admitted to an intensive care unit or unit with corresponding level of monitoring. As a rule, pediatric patients with DKA should have hourly assessments and adjustments of therapy.

**9. Effective Osmolality**
- A rapid drop in effective serum osmolarity can lead to cerebral edema. The type and composition of fluid can be altered to prevent a too rapid decrease in effective osmolality. Osmolarity can be maintained by continuing treatment with 0.9% saline and by adding glucose and potassium to the infusion.
- **Adults:** plasma osmolarity be lowered no faster than 3 mmol/L/h in order to avoid cerebral edema. Continued use of 0.9% saline is recommended if the corrected sodium is low or if

The rate of fall of effective serum osmolarity is ≥ 3 mmol/kg/hr. Switching to 0.45% saline is recommended if the corrected sodium is normal or high and the rate of fall of effective serum osmolarity is < 3 mmol/kg/hr . Corrected sodium is calculated by adding 2.4 mmol/L to the serum Na for each incremental rise of 5.5 mmol/L of serum glucose above a standard serum glucose value of 5.5 mmol/L.

• Children among whom the risk of cerebral edema is greatest, some recommend that effective osmolality not be permitted to decrease during the first 15 hours of treatment. Potassium chloride, 30-40 mmol/L, added to 0.9% saline, results in a solution with an effective osmolality that is close to the initial effective osmolality of the urine of children with ketoacidosis.

# Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar Syndrome

## INTRODUCTION
Hyperglycemia Hyperosmolar Syndrome (HHS) is characterized by hyperglycemia that has resulted in dehydration due to osmotic diuresis and thereby hyperosmolarity. The degree of dehydration in HHS is more severe than in diabetic ketoacidosis. With HHS, endogenous insulin levels are inadequate for glucose utilization by insulin-sensitive tissues but adequate to prevent lipolysis and ketogenesis.

| Diagnostic criteria in adults | Diagnostic criteria in children |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| • Plasma glucose > 33 mmol/L | • Plasma glucose > 33.3 mmol/L |
| • Arterial pH > 7.30 | • Venous pH > 7.25; arterial pH > 7.30 |
| • Serum bicarbonate > 18 mEq/L | • Serum bicarbonate > 15 mmol/L |
| • Minimal to no ketonuria or ketonemia | • Small ketonuria, absent to mild ketonemia |
| • Effective serum osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg | • Effective serum osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg |
| • Altered sensorium | • Altered consciousness (e.g., obtundation, combativeness) or seizures. |

## CONTEXT
• Patients who develop HHS are mainly those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).<br>
• The main symptoms that bring patients with HHS to medical attention are **decreased level of consciousness, seizures and stroke-like states**.

## ABCDE
| | |
|-|-|
|A| • Dry mucous membranes may be present |
|B| • Tachypnea (but not Kussmaul respiration) is common |
|C| • Hypotension may be present<br>• Tachycardia may be present |
|D| • Profound lethargy or coma may be present<br>• Focal neurological signs (hemiparesis, hemiparesis) may occur<br>• Seizures (partial or generalized) may occur |
|E| • Fever may be present since infection is a common precipitant of HHS.<br>• Normo- or hypothermia are common due to peripheral vasoconstriction.<br>• Poor skin turgor may be present. |

## BEDSIDE TESTS
| | |
|-|-|
|BBT| • pH may be < 7.25 when severe HHS results in elevated lactate.<br>• Anion gap may be increased due to renal failure or elevated lactate from hypoperfusion or underlying infection.<br>• Glucose is usually > 34 mmol/L in HHS.<br>• Effective osmolality (2 x Na + Glucose) > 320 mmol/L.<br>• Potassium levels are usually normal to high due to volume contraction and some degree of acidosis, despite the fact that total body potassium is usually more profoundly depleted in HHS than in DKA.<br>• Hemoglobin levels may be falsely elevated due to dehydration. |

# MANAGEMENT

1. **Resuscitation Fluid**
- Adults: 0.9% saline 1-2 liters is recommended if the patient is in shock.
- Children: 0.9% saline 20 ml/kg bolus is recommended. Additional fluid boluses should be given if needed to restore peripheral circulation.

2. **Fluid Repletion**
- Adults: 0.9% saline 1-1.5 L may be given during the first hour and a total of 3-4 L given during the first 4 hours. The type and rate of fluid thereafter should be individualized depending on vital signs, electrolyte levels and urinary output. In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, overhydration will lead to congestive pulmonary edema. The role of fluid therapy for these patients is limited; instead, insulin should be administered to shift glucose, fluid and potassium back into the intracellular space.
- Children: 0.45 - 0.75% saline should be administered after the initial fluid bolus to replace the deficit over 24-48 hrs, to goal being a gradual decline in serum sodium and serum osmolarity. A fluid deficit of 12-15% is expected. Replacement of urinary losses is recommended.

3. **Potassium Repletion**
- Adults: if the initial potassium is < 3.3 mmol/L, potassium replacement should begin immediately at a rate of up to 40 mmol/L/hr. Otherwise, potassium replacement is initiated once urinary output is assured and the potassium is < 5 mmol/L.
- Children: Potassium (40 mmol/L) should be added to the replacement fluid as soon as the serum potassium is within the normal range and adequate renal function has been established.

4. **Insulin**
- Insulin therapy should be delayed until hemodynamic stability is achieved and withheld if the serum potassium is < 3.3 mmol/L.
- Adults: American guidelines recommend insulin 0.1 U/kg/h IV after rehydration and correction of hypokalemia. UK guidelines recommend 0.05 U/kg/h IV if the patient has 3-β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations >1.0 mmol/L or if the rate of glucose drop is < 5 mmol/L/h.
- Children: insulin should be administered when serum glucose is no longer declining by > 3 mmol/L/h with fluid therapy alone. At this point, insulin is administered at the rate of 0.025 - 0.05 U/kg/hr. The dose should be titrated to obtain a decline in serum glucose of 3-4 mmol/L/h.

5. **Underlying Cause**
- Inadequate insulin therapy and infection are the most common precipitating factors in patients with HHS. Other precipitating factors include pancreatitis, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, drugs (e.g. corticosteroids, thiazides).

6. **Admission & Monitoring**
- Adults: should receive careful monitoring and therapeutic adjustments initially.
- Children: should be admitted to ICU or unit with corresponding level of monitoring

**7. Effective Osmolality & Corrected Serum Sodium**
- **Adults:** the effective osmolarity should not be decreased by more than 3 mOsm/kg/h in order to avoid the risk of cerebral edema (especially in young patients). The type and composition of fluid can be altered to prevent a too rapid decrease in effective osmolality. Osmolality can be lowered about by switching from 0.9% saline to 0.45%. Osmolality can be maintained by continuing treatment with 0.9% saline and by adding glucose to the infusion. Adding potassium to the infusion will also increase the osmolarity of the infusion.
- **Children:** the serum concentration in fluids should be adjusted to promote a gradual decline in corrected serum sodium concentration. Corrected sodium is calculated by adding 2.4 mmol/L to the serum Na for each incremental rise of 3.5 mmol/L of serum glucose above a standard serum glucose value of 5.5 mmol/L. A target decline of 0.5 mmol/L/h after initial fluid resuscitation is recommended.

**8. Glucose**
- **Adults:** an infusion of 5% glucose should be started once the glucose level reaches 16 mmol/L.
- **Children:** if there is a continued rapid fall in serum glucose after the first few hours (> 5mmol/L/hr), consider adding 2.5% or 5% glucose to the rehydration infusion.

**9. Thrombosis Prophylaxis**
- Enoxaparin (Klexane) 40 E SC daily

# STEMI & OMI

## INTRODUCTION
### STEMI
STEMI stands for ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction. The rational behind the STEMI concept is to identify patients with acute coronary artery occlusions who benefit from emergent reperfusion therapy. According to the 4th Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, the following suggest acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the absence of left ventricular hypertrophy and bundle branch block (0.1 mV = 1 mm):

| Leads | Pathologic ST Elevation |
|-------|------------------------|
| • V2-V3 | New ST-elevation at the J-point in 2 contiguous leads:<br>• ≥ 2.5 mm in men < 40 years-old<br>• ≥ 2.0 mm in required in men ≥ 40 years-old<br>• ≥ 1.5 mm in women regardless of age |
| • V7-V9 | New ST-elevation at the J-point in 2 contiguous leads in the presence of<br>ST-depression in V1-V3, especially when terminal T-wave is positive:<br>• ≥ 1.0 mm in V7-V9 in men < 40 years-old<br>• ≥ 0.5 mm in V7-V9 in men ≥ 40 years-old and in women |
| • All other leads<br>(incl. V4R) | New ST-elevation at the J-point in 2 contiguous leads:<br>• ≥ 1.0 mm |

### OMI
OMI stands for Occlusion Myocardial Infarction. OMI is defined as "acute coronary occlusion (ACO) or near occlusion with insufficient collateral circulation, such that downstream myocardium will undergo imminent infarction without timely reperfusion."
STEMI-criteria are 25% false-positive and 25% false-negative for ACO. The rational behind the OMI concept is to highlight EKG-criteria for ACO that do not meet STEMI criteria.

### OMI with Left Bundle Branch Block
Acute coronary occlusion if ≥ 1 of the following criteria is present:

| Modified Sgarbossa | BARCELONA |
|-------------------|------------|
| • ST depression > 1 mm in V1, V2 or V3<br>• ST elevation ≥ 1 mm concordant with the QRS<br>• ST elevation > 1 mm and > 25% of the amplitude of the S wave (STE/S wave ≤ -0.25) | • ST deviation > 1 mm concordant with QRS<br>• ST deviation > 1 mm discordant with QRS in leads with max R or S ≤ 6 mm |

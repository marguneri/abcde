# Status Epilepticus

## INTRODUCTION

Status epilepticus has been classically defined as > 30 min of continuous or intermittent seizures without recovery of consciousness. From a practical standpoint, continuous or intermittent seizures lasting > 5 min warrant pharmacological therapy, since the seizures are less likely to spontaneously terminate and more likely to cause neuronal damage

Eclampsia refers to a generalized tonic-clonic seizure occurring in a patient with signs of preeclampsia, in the absence of other neurological conditions that could account for the seizure. Roughly 60% of eclampsia cases occur prepartum, 20% intrapartum, and 20% postpartum, of which 90% occur during the first week since delivery

## ABCDE

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| A | • Trauma to the head and neck may precede or follow loss of consciousness<br>• **Lateral tongue bite SN 24% SP 99% for tonic clonic epileptic seizure.** |
| B | • Hypoxia is a reversible cause of seizure. SpO2 can be falsely elevated in CO poisoning.<br>• Bradypnea may be present, **tachypnea may be a response to lactic acidosis.** |
| C | • Tachycardia may present |
| D | • Consciousness is absent in generalized seizures and is present or impaired with a focal seizure. **Bilateral motor movements with preserved consciousness suggests psychogenic pseudoseizure.**<br>• Eye movements: blinking, shaky eye movement and gaze deviation may be the only clue to a non-convulsive status epilepticus<br>• Limb movements: sustained, rhythmic, bilateral tonic and clonic movements suggest generalized convulsive status epilepticus. *Jerking movements restricted to one area of the body suggests a focal motor seizure.* |
| E | • Fever may suggest that the seizure is triggered by an infection<br>• Signs of meningismus may suggest meningoencephalitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage.<br>• Petechiae suggest meningitis or a thrombocytopathic hemolytic anemia.<br>• Body examination may reveal signs of trauma secondary to loss of consciousness.<br>• **Warm, dry skin may suggest an anticholinergic toxidrome** (e.g. tricyclic overdose). |

## BEDSIDE TESTS

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| BBT | • **Hypoglycemia is the most common metabolic cause of seizure activity**; it may also result from prolonged seizure activity<br>• Hypoxia, hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia are other metabolic causes of seizure.<br>• Lactic acidosis from skeletal muscle is often present; in a third of adults in status epilepticus, the arterial pH falls below 7.0. *The absence of lactic acidosis argues against a true generalized seizure and suggests pseudoseizure.* |

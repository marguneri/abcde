# Sign-In

This algorithm is indicated prior to the team management of a potentially critical patient. Its purpose is to prime to the team. The 'Sign-In' is an adapted version of the WHO (World Health Organization) Surgical Safety Checklist Time-Out organized according to the SBAR communication format.

| Step | Checklist Items |
|------|----------------|
| 1. Situation | □ Team introduction (first name & role)<br>□ Patient's age & problem |
| 2. Background | □ Pertinent prior medical history<br>□ Current event (e.g. ambulance report) |
| 3. Assessment | □ Potential conditions?<br>□ Potential measures? |
| 4. Recommendation | □ Roles? Need for extra personnel? Crowd-control?<br>□ Suggestions from team-members? |

# ABCDE

| Category and Checks | Actions/Considerations |
|------------|----------------------|
| **1. Airway & C-spine** |  |
| □ Head & neck inspection | Manual stabilisation of the cervical spine? |
| □ Assess airway sounds // EtCO₂¹ | Airway opening maneuvers?² Adrenalin 1 mg Neb? |
| □ Oral cavity // ET tube inspection¹ | Lateral decubitus, suction, MgGill forceps? |
| **2. Breathing** |  |
| □ SpO₂ | Supplemental oxygen? |
| □ Respiratory rate | Ventilate with bag-valve-mask? |
| □ Chest wall examination | Ventilate (low tidal volume)? Seal (open chest)? |
| □ Pulmonary auscultation | Salbutamol 5 mg (2.5 mg if < 5 years) Neb? |
| **3. Circulation** |  |
| □ Pulse/blood pressure/CRT³ | Hemostasis, IV/IO access? |
| □ Heart rate | Crystalloid 500 ml IV bolus (10 ml/kg)? |
| □ 2-lead-EKG | Adrenalin 0.5 mg IM, external pacing? |
| **4. Disability** |  |
| □ Level of consciousness⁴ | Bensodiazepine if agitated? |
| □ Eyes (opening, gaze, pupils) |  |
| □ Distal sensation & strength |  |
| □ Glucose | Glucose 30% 30 ml (Glucose 10% 2 ml/kg)⁵ |
| **5. Exposure** |  |
| □ Front of the body examination | Stabilisation measures (pelvis, limbs)? |
| □ Back of the body examination | Log-roll, stabilisation of the spine? |
| □ Temperature | Prevent / treat hypo- hyperthermia? |

**Notes:**
1. If the patient is intubated
2. Airway opening maneuvers include the following (from least to most invasive): Head-tilt & Chin-lift or Jaw-Thrust, oral or nasal pharyngeal tube, extra glottic airway device (e.g. laryngeal mask airway), endotracheal intubation, cricothyrotomy. If Foreign Body Aspiration, other specific measures are indicated (see Foreign Body Airway Obstruction)
3. CRT (Capillary Refill Time) is mainly of value in children
4. According to ACVPU: Alert, Confused, responds to Voice, Pain, Unresponsive.
5. In the absence of IV/IO access, administer Glucagon 1 mg (< 6 years 0.5 mg) IM or SC.
